<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a><h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<br />

<p>From the remote period; when the Roman province was contracted by the
ramparts of Severus, until the union of the kingdoms, the borders
of Scotland formed the stage, upon which were presented the most
memorable conflicts of two gallant nations. The inhabitants, at the
commencement of this aera, formed the first wave of the torrent which
assaulted, and finally overwhelmed, the barriers of the Roman power
in Britain. The subsequent events, in which they were engaged, tended
little to diminish their military hardihood, or to reconcile them to
a more civilized state of society. We have no occasion to trace the
state of the borders during the long and obscure period of Scottish
history, which preceded the accession of the Stuart family. To
illustrate a few ballads,<span class="newpage"><a name="pageii" id="pageii">[ii]</a></span> the earliest of which is hardly coeval with
James V. such an enquiry would be equally difficult and vain. If we
may trust the Welch bards, in their account of the wars betwixt the
Saxons and Danes of Deira and the Cumraig, imagination can hardly
form any idea of conflicts more desperate, than were <span class="rightnote">[570]</span>
maintained, on the borders, between the ancient British and their
Teutonic invaders. Thus, the Gododin describes the waste and
devastation of mutual havoc, in colours so glowing, as strongly to
recall the words of Tacitus; &quot;<i>Et ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem
appellant</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.&quot;</p>

<p>At a later period, the Saxon families, who fled from the exterminating
sword of the Conqueror, with many of the Normans themselves, whom
discontent and intestine feuds had driven into exile,<span class="newpage"><a name="pageiii" id="pageiii">[iii]</a></span> began to rise
into eminence upon the Scottish borders. They brought with them
arts, both of peace and of war, unknown in Scotland; and, among their
descendants, we soon number the most powerful border chiefs. Such,
<span class="rightnote">[1249]</span>
during the reign of the last Alexander, were Patrick,
earl of March, and Lord Soulis, renowned in tradition; and such were,
also, the powerful Comyns, who early acquired the principal sway upon
the Scottish marches. <span class="rightnote">[1300]</span>In the civil wars betwixt Bruce
and Baliol, all those powerful chieftains espoused the unsuccessful
party. They were forfeited and exiled; and upon their ruins was
founded the formidable house of Douglas. The borders, from sea to
sea, were now at the devotion of a succession of mighty chiefs, whose
exorbitant power threatened to place a new dynasty upon the Scottish
throne. It is not my intention to trace the dazzling career of this
race of heroes, whose exploits were alike formidable to the English,
and to their sovereign.</p>

<p>The sun of Douglas set in blood. The murders of the sixth earl, and
his brother, in the castle of Edinburgh, were followed by that of
their successor, poignarded at Stirling by the hand of<span class="newpage"><a name="pageiv" id="pageiv">[iv]</a></span> his prince. His
brother, Earl James, appears neither to have possessed the abilities
nor the ambition of his ancestors. He drew, indeed, against his
prince, the formidable sword of Douglas, but with a timid and
hesitating hand. Procrastination ruined his cause; and he was
deserted, at Abercorn, by the knight of Cadyow, chief of the
Hamiltons, and by his most active adherents, after they had
ineffectually exhorted him to commit <span class="rightnote">[1453]</span>his fate to the
issue of a battle. The border chiefs, who longed for independence,
shewed little <span class="rightnote">[1455]</span>inclination to follow the declining
fortunes of Douglas. On the contrary, the most powerful clans engaged
and defeated him, at Arkinholme, in Annandale, when, after a short
residence in England, he again endeavoured to gain a footing in his
native country<a name="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The spoils of Douglas were liberally distributed
among his conquerors, and royal grants of his forfeited domains
effectually interested them in excluding his return. An<span class="rightnote">[1457]</span>
attempt, on the east borders, by &quot;<i>the Percy and the Douglas,
both together</i>,&quot; was equally unsuccessful.<span class="newpage"><a name="pagev" id="pagev">[v]</a></span> The earl, grown old in
exile, longed once more to see his native country, and vowed, that,
<span class="rightnote">[1483]</span>upon Saint Magdalen's day, he would deposit his
offering on the high altar at Lochmaben.&mdash;Accompanied by the banished
earl of Albany, with his usual ill fortune, he entered Scotland.&mdash;The
borderers assembled to oppose him, and he suffered a final defeat at
Burnswark, in Dumfries-shire. The aged earl was taken in the fight, by
a son of Kirkpatrick of Closeburn, one of his own vassals. A grant of
lands had been offered for his person: &quot;Carry me to the king!&quot; said
Douglas to Kirkpatrick: &quot;thou art well entitled to profit by my
misfortune; for thou wast true to me,<span class="newpage"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi">[vi]</a></span> while I was true to myself.&quot;
The young man wept bitterly, and offered to fly with the earl into
England. But Douglas, weary of exile, refused his proffered liberty,
and only requested, that Kirkpatrick would not deliver him to the
king, till he had secured his own reward<a name="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. Kirkpatrick did more:
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagevii" id="pagevii">[vii]</a></span>
he stipulated for the personal safety of his old master. His generous
intercession prevailed; and the last of the Douglasses was permitted
to die, in monastic seclusion, in the abbey of Lindores.</p>

<p>After the fall of the house of Douglas, no one chieftain appears to
have enjoyed the same extensive supremacy over the Scottish borders.
The various barons, who had partaken of the spoil, combined in
resisting a succession of uncontrouled domination. The earl of Angus
alone seems to have taken rapid steps in the same course of ambition
which had been pursued by his kinsmen and rivals, the earls of
Douglas. Archibald, sixth earl of Angus, called <i>Bell-the-Cat</i>,
was, at once, warden of the east and middle marches, Lord of
Liddisdale and Jedwood forest, and possessed of the strong castles
of Douglas, Hermitage, and Tantallon. Highly esteemed by the ancient
nobility, a faction which he headed shook the throne of the feeble
James III., whose person they restrained, and whose minions they led
to<span class="newpage"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii">[viii]</a></span> an ignominious death. The king failed not to shew his sense of
these insults, though unable effectually to avenge them. This hastened
his fate: and the field of Bannockburn, once the scene of a more
glorious conflict, beheld the combined chieftains of the border
counties arrayed against their sovereign, under the banners of his own
son. The king was supported by almost all the barons of the north; but
the tumultuous ranks of the Highlanders were ill able to endure the
steady and rapid charge of the men of Annandale and Liddisdale, who
bare spears, two ells longer than were used by the rest of their
countrymen. The yells, with which they accompanied their onset,
caused the heart of James to quail within him. He deserted his host,
<span class="rightnote">[1488]</span>and fled towards Stirling; but, falling from his
horse, he was murdered by the pursuers.</p>

<p>James IV., a monarch of a vigorous and energetic character, was well
aware of the danger which his ancestors had experienced, from the
preponderance of one overgrown family. He is supposed to have smiled
internally, when the border and highland champions bled and died in
the savage sports of chivalry, by which his nuptials<span class="newpage"><a name="pageix" id="pageix">[ix]</a></span> were solemnized.
Upon the waxing power of Angus he kept a wary eye; and, embracing the
occasion of a casual slaughter, he compelled that earl, and his son,
to exchange the lordship of Liddisdale and the castle of Hermitage,
for the castle and lordship of Bothwell<a name="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. By this policy, he
prevented the house of Angus, mighty as it was, from rising to the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagex" id="pagex">[x]</a></span>
height, whence the elder branch of their family had been hurled.</p>

<p>Nor did James fail in affording his subjects on the marches marks
of his royal justice and protection. <span class="rightnote">[1510]</span>The clan of
Turnbull having been guilty of unbounded excesses, the king came
suddenly to Jedburgh, by a night march, and executed the most rigid
justice upon the astonished offenders. Their submission was made with
singular solemnity. Two hundred of the tribe met the king, at the
water of Rule, holding in their hands the naked swords, with which
they had perpetrated their crimes, and having each around his neck the
halter which he had well merited. A few were capitally punished, many
imprisoned, and the rest dismissed, after they had given hostages
for their future peaceable demeanour.&mdash;<i>Holinshed's Chronicle,
Lesly</i>.</p>

<p>The hopes of Scotland, excited by the prudent and spirited conduct
of James, were doomed to a sudden and fatal reverse. Why should
we recapitulate the painful tale of the defeat and death of a
high-spirited prince? Prudence, policy, the prodigies of superstition,
and the advice of his most<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi">[xi]</a></span> experienced counsellors, were alike unable
to subdue in James the blazing zeal of romantic chivalry. The monarch,
and the flower of his nobles, <span class="rightnote">[1513]</span>precipitately rushed to
the fatal field of Flodden, whence they were never to return.</p>

<p>The minority of James V. presents a melancholy scene. Scotland,
through all its extent, felt the truth of the adage, &quot;that the country
is hapless, whose prince is a child.&quot; But the border counties, exposed
from their situation to the incursions of the English, deprived of
many of their most gallant chiefs, and harassed by the intestine
struggles of the survivors, were reduced to a wilderness, inhabited
only by the beasts of the field, and by a few more brutal warriors.
Lord Home, the chamberlain and favourite of James IV., leagued with
the Earl of Angus, who married the widow of his sovereign, held, for
a time, the chief sway upon the east border. Albany, the regent of the
kingdom, bred in the French court, and more accustomed to wield the
pen than the sword, feebly endeavoured to controul a lawless nobility,
to whom his manners appeared strange, and his person<span class="rightnote">[1516]</span>
despicable. It was in vain that he inveigled<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexii" id="pagexii">[xii]</a></span> the Lord Home to
Edinburgh, where he was tried and executed. This example of justice,
or severity, only irritated the kinsmen and followers of the deceased
baron: for though, in other respects, not more sanguinary than the
rest of a barbarous nation, the borderers never dismissed from their
memory a deadly feud, till blood for blood had been exacted, to the
uttermost drachm<a name="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Of this, the fate of Anthony d'Arcey, Seigneur de
la Bastie, affords a melancholy example. This gallant French cavalier
was appointed warden of the east marches by Albany, at his first
disgraceful retreat to France. Though De la Bastie was an able
statesman, and a true son of chivalry, the choice of the regent was
nevertheless unhappy. The new warden was a foreigner, placed in the
office of Lord Home, as<span class="rightnote">[1517]</span> the delegate of the very man,
who had brought that baron to the scaffold. A stratagem, contrived by
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexiii" id="pagexiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Home of Wedderburn, who burned to avenge the death of his chief, drew
De la Bastie towards Langton, in the Merse. Here he found himself
surrounded by his enemies. In attempting, by the speed of his horse,
to gain the castle of Dunbar, the warden plunged into a morass, where
he was overtaken and cruelly butchered. Wedderburn himself cut off his
head; and, in savage triumph, knitted it to his saddle-bow by the
long flowing hair, which had been admired by the dames of
France.&mdash;<i>Pitscottie, Edit</i>. 1728, p. 130. <i>Pinkerton's History
of Scotland</i>, Vol. II. p. 169<a name="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The Earl of Arran, head of the house of Hamilton was appointed to
succeed De la Bastie in his perilous office. But the Douglasses, the
Homes, and the Kerrs, proved too strong for him upon the <span class="rightnote">[1520]</span> border.
He was routed by these clans, at Kelso, and afterwards
in a sharp skirmish, fought betwixt<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv">[xiv]</a></span> his faction and that of Angus, in
the high-street of the metropolis<a name="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The return of the regent was followed by the banishment of Angus,
and by a desultory warfare<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexv" id="pagexv">[xv]</a></span> with England, carried on with mutual
incursions. Two gallant armies, levied by Albany, were dismissed
without any exploit worthy notice, while Surrey, at the head of ten
thousand cavalry, burned Jedburgh, and laid waste all Tiviotdale. This
general pays a splendid tribute to the gallantry of the border chiefs.
He terms them &quot;the boldest <span class="rightnote">[1523]</span>men, and the hottest, that
ever I saw any nation<a name="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Disgraced and detested, Albany bade adieu to Scotland for ever. The
queen-mother, and the Earl of Arran, for some time swayed the kingdom.
But their power was despised on the borders, where Angus, though
banished, had many friends. Scot of Buccleuch even appropriated to
himself domains, belonging to the queen, worth 4000 merks yearly;
being probably the castle of Newark and her jointure lands in Ettrick
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexvi" id="pagexvi">[xvi]</a></span>
forest<a name="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.&mdash;</p>

<p>This chief, with Kerr of Cessford, was committed to ward, from which
they escaped, to join <span class="rightnote">[1525]</span>the party of the exiled Angus.
Leagued with these, and other border chiefs, Angus effected his return
to Scotland, where he shortly after acquired possession of the supreme
power, and of the person of the youthful king. &quot;The ancient power of
the Douglasses,&quot; says the accurate historian, whom I have so often
referred to, &quot;seemed to have revived; and, after a slumber of near
a century, again to threaten destruction to the Scottish
monarchy.&quot;&mdash;<i>Pinkerton</i>, Vol. 11, p. 277.</p>

<p>In fact, the time now returned, when no one durst strive with a
Douglas, or with his follower. For, although Angus used the outward
pageant of conducting the king around the country, for punishing
thieves and traitors, &quot;yet,&quot; says Pitscottie, &quot;none were found greater
than were in his own company.&quot; The high spirit of the young king was
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexvii" id="pagexvii">[xvii]</a></span>
galled by the ignominious restraint under which he found himself; and,
in a progress to the border for repressing the Armstrongs, he probably
gave such signs of dissatisfaction, as excited the <span class="rightnote">[1526]</span>
laird of Buccleuch to attempt his rescue.</p>

<p>This powerful baron was the chief of a hardy clan, inhabiting Ettrick
forest, Eskdale, Ewsdale, the higher part of Tiviotdale, and a portion
of Liddesdale. In this warlike district he easily levied a thousand
horse, comprehending a large body of Elliots, Armstrongs, and other
broken clans, over whom the laird of Buccleuch exercised an extensive
authority; being termed, by Lord Dacre, &quot;chief maintainer of all
misguided men on the borders of Scotland.&quot;&mdash;<i>Letter to Wolsey</i>,
July 18. 1528. The Earl of Angus, with his reluctant ward, had slept
at Melrose; and the clans of Home and Kerr, under the Lord Home, and
the barons of Cessford, and Fairnihirst, had taken their leave of
the king, when, in the gray of the morning, Buccleuch and his band
of cavalry were discovered, hanging, like a thunder-cloud, upon the
neighbouring hill of Haliden<a name="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. A herald was sent to demand his
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexviii" id="pagexviii">[xviii]</a></span>
purpose, and to charge him to retire. To the first point he answered,
that he came to shew his clan to the king, according to the custom of
the borders; to the second, that he knew the king's mind better than
Angus.&mdash;When this haughty answer was reported to the earl, &quot;Sir,&quot; said
he to the king, &quot;yonder is Buccleuch, with the thieves of Annandale
and Liddesdale, to bar your grace's passage. I vow to God they shall
either fight or flee. Your grace shall tarry on this hillock, with my
brother George; and I will either clear your road of yonder banditti,
or die in the attempt.&quot; The earl, with these words, alighted, and
hastened to the charge; while the Earl of Lennox (at whose instigation
Buccleuch made the attempt), remained with the king, an inactive
spectator. Buccleuch and his followers likewise dismounted, and
received the assailants with a dreadful shout, and a shower of lances.
The encounter was fierce and obstinate;<span class="newpage"><a name="pageixx" id="pageixx">[ixx]</a></span> but the Homes and Kerrs,
returning at the noise of battle, bore down and dispersed the left
wing of Buccleuch's little army. The hired banditti fled on all sides;
but the chief himself, surrounded by his clan, fought desperately
in the retreat. The laird of Cessford, chief of the Roxburgh Kerrs,
pursued the chace fiercely; till, at the bottom of a steep path,
Elliot of Stobs, a follower of Buccleuch, turned, and slew him with a
stroke of his lance. When Cessford fell, the pursuit ceased. But his
death, with those of Buccleuch's friends, who fell in the action, to
the number of eighty, occasioned a deadly feud betwixt the names
of Scott and Kerr, which cost much blood upon the marches<a name="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.&mdash;See
<i>Pitscottie</i>, <i>Lesly</i>, and <i>Godscroft</i>.</p>
<br />

<p><span class="rightnote">[1528]</span>Stratagem at length effected what force had been
unable to accomplish; and the king, emancipated from the iron tutelage
of Angus, made the<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexx" id="pagexx">[xx]</a></span> first use of his authority, by banishing from
the kingdom his late lieutenant, and the whole race of Douglas. This
command was not enforced without difficulty; for the power of Angus
was strongly rooted in the east border, where he possessed the castle
of Tantallon, and the hearts of the Homes and Kerrs. The former, whose
strength was proverbial<a name="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>, defied a royal army; and the latter, at
the Pass of Pease, baffled the Earl of Argyle's attempts to enter the
Merse, as lieutenant of his sovereign. On this occasion, the borderers
regarded with wonder and contempt the barbarous array, and rude
equipage, of their northern countrymen Godscroft has preserved the
beginning of a scoffing rhyme, made upon this occasion:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Earl of Argyle is bound to ride</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the border of Edgebucklin brae<a name="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all his habergeons him beside,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each man upon a sonk of strae.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They made their vow that they would slay&mdash;</span><br />
<p></p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Godscroft</i>, v. 2. p. 104. Ed. 1743.</span><br />
<br />

<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxi" id="pagexxi">[xxi]</a></span>
<p>The pertinacious opposition of Angus to his doom irritated to the
extreme the fiery temper of James, and he swore, in his wrath, that a
Douglas should never serve him; an oath which he kept in circumstances
under which the spirit of chivalry, which he worshipped<a name="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>, should
have taught him other feelings.</p>

<p>While these transactions, by which the fate of Scotland was
influenced, were passing upon the eastern border, the Lord
Maxwell seems to have<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxii" id="pagexxii">[xxii]</a></span> exercised a most uncontrouled domination in
Dumfries-shire. Even the power of the Earl of Angus was exerted in
vain, against the banditti of Liddesdale, protected and bucklered
by this mighty chief. Repeated complaints are made by the English
residents, of the devastation occasioned by the depredations of the
Elliots, Scotts, and Armstrongs, connived at, and encouraged, by
Maxwell, <span class="rightnote">[1528]</span>Buccleuch, and Fairnihirst. At a convention
of border commissioners, it was agreed, that the king of England,
in case the excesses of the Liddesdale freebooters were not duly
redressed, should be at liberty to issue letters of reprisal to his
injured subjects, granting &quot;power to invade the said inhabitants of
Liddesdale, to their slaughters, burning, heirships, robbing, reifing,
despoiling and destruction, and so to continue the same at his<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxiii" id="pagexxiii">[xxiii]</a></span> grace's
pleasure,&quot; till the attempts of the inhabitants were fully atoned
for. This impolitic expedient, by which the Scottish prince, unable
to execute justice on his turbulent subjects, committed to a rival
sovereign the power of unlimited chastisement, was a principal cause
of the savage state of the borders. For the inhabitants, finding
that the sword of revenge was substituted for that of justice, were
loosened from their attachment to Scotland, and boldly threatened to
carry on their depredations, in spite of the efforts of both kingdoms.</p>

<p>James V., however, was not backward in using more honourable
expedients to quell the banditti <span class="rightnote">[1529]</span>on the borders. The
imprisonment of their chiefs, and a noted expedition, in which many of
the principal thieves were executed (see introduction to the ballad,
called <i>Johnie Armstrong</i>), produced such good effects, that,
according to an ancient picturesque history, &quot;thereafter there was
great peace and rest a long time, where through the king had great
profit; for he had ten thousand sheep going in the Ettrick forest, in
keeping by Andrew Bell, who made the king so good count of them, as
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxiv" id="pagexxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
they had gone in the hounds of Fife.&quot; <i>Pitscottie</i>, p. 153.</p>

<p>A breach with England interrupted the tranquillity <span class="rightnote">[1533]</span>
of the borders. The Earl of Northumberland, a formidable name to
Scotland, ravaged the middle marches, and burned Branxholm, the abode
of Buccleuch, the hereditary enemy of the English name. Buccleuch,
with the barons of Cessford and Fairnihirst, retaliated by a raid into
England, <span class="rightnote">[1533]</span>where they acquired much spoil. On the east
march, Fowberry was destroyed by the Scots, and Dunglass castle by
D'Arcey, and the banished Angus.</p>

<p>A short peace was quickly followed by another war, which proved fatal
to Scotland, and to her king. In the battle of Haddenrig, the English,
and the exiled Douglasses, were defeated by the Lords Huntly and Home;
but this was a transient gleam of success. Kelso was burned, and the
borders <span class="rightnote">[1542]</span>ravaged, by the Duke of Norfolk; and finally,
the rout of Solway moss, in which ten thousand men, the flower of the
Scottish army, were dispersed and defeated by a band of five hundred
English cavalry, or rather by their own dissentions, broke the proud
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxv" id="pagexxv">[xxv]</a></span>
heart of James; a death, more painful a hundred fold than was met by
his father in the field of Flodden.</p>

<p>When the strength of the Scottish army had sunk, without wounds,
and without renown, the principal chiefs were led captive into
England.&mdash;Among these was the Lord Maxwell, who was compelled, by the
menaces of Henry, to swear allegiance to the English monarch. There is
still in existence the spirited instrument of vindication, by which
he renounces his connection with England, and the honours and estates
which had been proffered him, as the price of treason to his infant
sovereign. From various bonds of manrent, it appears, that all
the western marches were swayed <span class="rightnote">[1543]</span>by this powerful
chieftain. With Maxwell, and the other captives, returned to Scotland
the banished Earl of Angus, and his brother, Sir George Douglas, after
a banishment of fifteen years. This powerful family regained at least
a part of their influence upon the borders; and, grateful to the
kingdom which had afforded them protection during their exile, became
chiefs of the English faction in Scotland, whose object it was to urge
a contract of<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxvi" id="pagexxvi">[xxvi]</a></span> marriage betwixt the young queen and the heir apparent
of England. The impetuosity of Henry, the ancient hatred betwixt the
nations, and the wavering temper of the governor, Arran, prevented
the success of this measure. The wrath of the disappointed monarch
discharged itself in a wide-wasting and furious invasion of the
east marches, conducted by the Earl of Hertford. Seton, Home,
and Buccleuch, hanging on the mountains of Lammermoor, saw, with
ineffectual regret, the fertile plains of Merse and Lothian, and the
metropolis itself, reduced to a smoking desert. Hertford had scarcely
retreated with the main army, when Evers and Latoun laid waste the
whole vale of Tiviot, with a ferocity of devastation, hitherto unheard
of<a name="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>. The same &quot;lion mode of wooing,&quot; being pursued during the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxvii" id="pagexxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
minority of Edward VI., totally alienated the affections even of those
Scots who were most attached to the English interest. The Earl of
Angus, in particular, united himself to the governor, and gave the
English a sharp defeat at Ancram moor, <span class="rightnote">[1545]</span>a particular
account of which action is subjoined to the ballad, entituled, &quot;<i>The
Eve of St. John</i>.&quot; Even the fatal defeat at Pinky, which at once
renewed the carnage of Flodden, and the disgrace of Solway, served to
prejudice the cause of the victors. The borders saw, with dread and
detestation, the ruinous fortress of Roxburgh once more receive an
English garrison, and the widow of Lord Home driven from his
baronial castle, to <span class="rightnote">[1547]</span>make room for the &quot;<i>Southern
Reivers</i>.&quot; Many of the barons made a reluctant submission to
Somerset; but those of the higher part of the marches remained among
their mountains, meditating revenge. A similar incursion was made on
the west borders by Lord Wharton, who, with five thousand men,
ravaged and overran Annandale, Nithsdale, and Galloway, compelling the
inhabitants to receive the yoke of England<a name="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxviii" id="pagexxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
<p>The arrival of French auxiliaries, and of French gold, rendered vain
the splendid successes of the English. One by one, the fortresses
which they occupied were recovered by force, or by stratagem; and the
vindictive cruelty of the Scottish borderers made dreadful retaliation
for the, injuries they had sustained. An idea may be conceived of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxix" id="pagexxix">[xxix]</a></span>
this horrible warfare, from the memoirs of Beaug&eacute;, a French officer,
serving in Scotland.</p>

<p>The castle of Fairnihirst, situated about three miles above Jedburgh,
had been taken and garrisoned by the English. The commander and his
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxx" id="pagexxx">[xxx]</a></span>
followers are accused of such excesses of lust and cruelty &quot;as would,&quot;
says Beaug&eacute;, &quot;have made to tremble the most savage moor in Africa.&quot; A
band of Frenchmen, with the laird of Fairnihirst, and <span class="rightnote">[1549]</span>
his borderers, assaulted this fortress. The English archers showered
their arrows down the steep ascent, leading to the castle, and from
the outer wall by which it was surrounded. A vigorous escalade,
however, gained the base court, and the sharp fire of the French
arquebusiers drove the bowmen into the square keep, or dungeon, of the
fortress. Here the English defended themselves, till a breach in the
wall was made by mining. Through this hole the commandant creeped
forth; and, surrendering himself to De la Mothe-rouge, implored
protection from the vengeance of the borderers. But a Scottish
marc-hman, eyeing in the captive the ravisher of his wife, approached
him ere the French officer could guess his intention, and, at one
blow, carried his head four paces from the trunk. Above a hundred
Scots rushed to wash their hands in the blood of their oppressor,
bandied about the severed head, and expressed their joy in such
shouts, as if they had stormed the city of London. The prisoners, who
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxi" id="pagexxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
fell into their merciless hands, were put to death, after their eyes
had been torn out; the victors contending who should display the
greatest address in severing their legs and arms, before inflicting a
mortal wound. When their own prisoners were slain, the Scottish, with
an unextinguishable thirst for blood, purchased those of the French;
parting willingly with their very arms, in exchange for an English
captive. &quot;I myself,&quot; says Beaug&eacute;, with military sang-froid, &quot;I myself
sold them a prisoner for a small horse. They laid him down upon the
ground, galloped over him with their lances in rest, and wounded him
as they passed. When slain, they cut his body in pieces, and bore the
mangled gobbets, in triumph, on the points of their spears. I cannot
greatly praise the Scottish for this practice. But the truth is, that
the English tyrannized over the borders in a most barbarous manner;
and I think it was but fair to repay them, according to the proverb,
in their own coin.&quot;&mdash;</p>
<br />

<p><i>Campagnes de Beaug&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>A peace, in 1551, put an end to this war; the most destructive which,
for a length of time, had ravaged Scotland. Some attention was paid by
the governor and queen-mother, to the administration of justice on the
border; and the chieftains, who had distinguished themselves during
the late troubles, received the honour of knighthood<a name="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>.
<span class="rightnote">[1522]</span>At this time, also, the Debateable Land, a tract of country,
situated betwixt the Esk and Sarke, claimed by both kingdoms, was
divided by royal commissioners, appointed by the two crowns.&mdash;By their
award, this land of contention was separated by a line, drawn from
east to west, betwixt the rivers. The upper half was adjudged to
Scotland, and the more eastern part to England. Yet the Debateable
Land continued long after to be the residence of the thieves
and banditti, to whom its dubious state had afforded a desirable
refuge<a name="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxii" id="pagexxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
<p>In 1557, a new war broke out, in which rencounters on the borders
were, as usual, numerous, and with varied success. In some of these,
the too famous Bothwell is said to have given proofs of his courage,
which was at other times very questionable<a name="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>. About this time the
Scottish borderers seem to have acquired some ascendency over their
southern neighbours.&mdash;<i>Strype</i>, Vol. III. p. 437&mdash;In 1559, peace
was again restored.</p>

<p>The flame of reformation, long stifled in Scotland, now burst forth,
with the violence of a volcanic eruption. The siege of Leith was
commenced, by the combined forces of the Congregation and of England.
The borderers cared little about speculative points of religion; but
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxiii" id="pagexxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
they shewed themselves much interested in the treasures which passed
through their country, for payment of the English forces at Edinburgh.
Much alarm was excited, lest the marchers should intercept these
weighty protestant arguments; and it was, probably, by voluntarily
imparting a share in them to Lord Home, that he became a sudden
convert to the new faith<a name="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the ill-fated Mary in her native country, she
found the borders in a state of great disorder. The exertions of her
natural brother (afterwards the famous regent, Murray) were necessary
to restore some degree of tranquillity. He marched to Jedburgh,
executed twenty or thirty of the transgressors, burned many houses,
and brought a number of prisoners to Edinburgh. The chieftains of the
principal clans were also obliged to grant pledges for their future
obedience. A noted convention (for the particulars of which, see
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxiv" id="pagexxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
<i>Border Laws</i>, p. 84.) adopted various regulations, which were
attended with great advantage to the marches<a name="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The unhappy match, betwixt Henry Darnley and his sovereign, led to new
dissentions on the border. The Homes, Kerrs, and other east marchers,
hastened to support the queen, against Murray, Chatelherault, and
other nobles, whom her marriage had offended. For the same purpose
the Johnstones, Jardines, and clans of Annandale entered into bonds of
confederacy. But Liddesdale was under the influence of England; in so
much, that Randolph, the English minister, proposed to hire a band of
<i>strapping Elliots</i>, to find Home business at home, in looking
after his corn and cattle.&mdash;<i>Keith</i>, p. 265. <i>App</i>. 133.</p>

<p>This storm was hardly overblown, when Bothwell received the commission
of lieutenant upon the borders; but, as void of parts as of principle,
he could not even recover to the queen's allegiance his own domains in
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxv" id="pagexxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
Liddesdale.&mdash;<i>Keith, App</i>. 165. The queen herself advanced to the
borders, to remedy this evil, and to hold courts at Jedburgh. Bothwell
was already in Liddesdale, where he had been severely wounded, in an
attempt to seize John Elliot, of the Parke, a desperate freebooter;
and happy had it been for Mary, had the dagger of the moss-trooper
struck more home. Bothwell being transported to his castle of
Hermitage, the queen, upon hearing the tidings, hastened thither, A
dangerous morass, still called the <i>Queen's Mire</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>, is pointed
out by tradition as the spot where the lovely Mary, and her white
palfrey, were in danger of perishing. The distance betwixt Hermitage
and Jedburgh, by the way of Hawick, is nearly twenty-four English
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxvi" id="pagexxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
miles. The queen went and returned the same day. Whether she visited a
wounded subject, or a lover in danger, has been warmly disputed in our
latter days.</p>

<p>To the death of Henry Darnley, it is said, some of the border lords
were privy. But the subsequent marriage, betwixt the queen and
Bothwell, alienated from her the affections of the chieftains of the
marches, most of whom aided the association of the insurgent barons.
A few gentlemen of the Merse, however, joined the army which Mary
brought to Carberry-hill. But no one was willing to fight for the
detested Bothwell, nor did Bothwell himself shew any inclination
to put his person in jeopardy. The result to Mary was a rigorous
captivity in Lochleven castle; and the name of Bothwell scarcely again
pollutes the page of Scottish history.</p>

<p>The distress of a beautiful and afflicted princess softened the hearts
of her subjects; and, when she escaped from her severe captivity, the
most powerful barons in Scotland crowded around her standard. Among
these were many of the west border men, under the lords Maxwell
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxvii" id="pagexxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
and Herries<a name="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>. But the defeat at Langside was a death-blow to her
interest in Scotland.</p>

<p>The death of the regent Murray, in 1569, excited the party of Mary to
hope and to exertion. It seems, that the design of Bothwelhaugh, who
slew him, was well known upon the borders; for, the very day on which
the slaughter happened, Buccleuch and Fairnihirst, with their clans,
broke into England, and spread devastation along the frontiers, with
unusual ferocity. It is probable they well knew that the controuling
hand of the regent was that day palsied by death. Buchanan exclaims
loudly against this breach of truce with Elizabeth, charging Queen
Mary's party with having &quot;houndit furth proude and uncircumspecte
young men, to hery, burne, and slay, and tak prisoneris, in her
realme, and use all misordour and crueltie, not only usit in weir, but
detestabil to all barbar and wild Tartaris, in slaying of prisoneris,
and contrair to all humanitie and justice, keeping na promeis to
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxviii" id="pagexxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
miserabil catives resavit anis to thair mercy &quot;&mdash;<i>Admonitioun to the
trew lordis, Striveling</i>, 1571. He numbers, among these insurgents,
highlanders as well as borderers, Buccleuch and Fairnihirst, the
Johnstons and Armstrongs, the Grants, and the clan Chattan. Besides
these powerful clans, Mary numbered among her adherents, the Maxwells,
and almost all the west border leaders, excepting Drumlanrig, and
Jardine of Applegirth. On the eastern border, the faction of the
infant king was more powerful; for, although deserted by Lord Home,
the greater part of his clan, under the influence of Wedderburn,
remained attached to that party. The laird of Cessford wished them
well, and the Earl of Angus naturally followed the steps of his uncle
Morton. A sharp and bloody invasion of the middle march, under the
command of the Earl of Sussex, avenged with interest the raids of
Buccleuch and Fairnihirst. The domains of these chiefs were laid
waste, their castles burned and destroyed. The narrow vales of
Beaumont and Kale, belonging to Buccleuch, were treated with peculiar
severity; and the forrays of Hertford were equalled by that of Sussex.
In vain did the chiefs request assistance from the government to
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexxxix" id="pagexxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
defend their fortresses. Through the predominating interest of
Elizabeth in the Scottish councils, this was refused to all but Home,
whose castle, nevertheless, again received an English garrison; while
Buccleuch and Fairnihirst complained bitterly that those, who had
instigated their invasion, durst not even come so far as Lauder, to
shew countenance to their defence against the English. The bickerings,
which followed, distracted the whole kingdom. One celebrated exploit
may be selected, as an illustration of the border fashion of war.</p>

<p>The Earl of Lennox, who had succeeded Murray in the regency, held a
parliament at Stirling, in 1571. The young king was exhibited to
the great council of his nation. He had been tutored to repeat a set
speech, composed for the occasion; but, observing that the roof of
the building was a little decayed, he interrupted his recitation,
and exclaimed, with childish levity, &quot;that there was a hole in the
parliament,&quot;&mdash;words which, in these days, were held to presage the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexl" id="pagexl">[xl]</a></span>
deadly breach shortly to be made in that body, by the death of him in
whose name it was convoked.</p>

<p>Amid the most undisturbed security of confidence, the lords, who
composed this parliament, were roused at day-break, by the shouts
of their enemies in the heart of the town. <i>God and the Queen</i>!
resounded from every quarter, and, in a few minutes, the regent, with
the astonished nobles of his party, were prisoners to a band of two
hundred border cavalry, led by Scott of Buccleuch, and to the
Lord Claud Hamilton, at the head of three hundred infantry. These
enterprising chiefs, by a rapid and well concerted manoeuvre, had
reached Stirling in a night march from Edinburgh, and, without so much
as being bayed at by a watch-dog had seized the principal street of
the town.&mdash;The fortunate obstinacy of Morton saved his party. Stubborn
and undaunted, he defended his house till the assailants set it in
flames, and then yielded with reluctance to his kinsman, Buccleuch.
But the time, which he had gained, effectually served his cause. The
borderers had dispersed to plunder the stables of the nobility; the
infantry thronged tumultuously together on the main street, when the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexli" id="pagexli">[xli]</a></span>
Earl of Mar, issuing from the castle, placed one or two small pieces
of ordnance in his own half-built house<a name="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>, which commands the market
place. Hardly had the artillery begun to scour the street, when the
assailants, surprised in their turn, fled with precipitation. Their
alarm was increased by the townsmen thronging to arms. Those, who had
been so lately triumphant, were now, in many instances, asking the
protection of their own prisoners. In all probability, not a man would
have escaped death, or captivity, but for the characteristic rapacity
of Buccleuch's marauders, who, having seized and carried off all the
horses in the town, left the victors no means of following the chace.
The regent was slain by an officer, named Caulder, in order to prevent
his being rescued. Spens of Ormeston, to whom he had surrendered, lost
his life in a generous attempt to protect him<a name="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>. Hardly does our
history present another enterprise, so well planned, so happily
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlii" id="pagexlii">[xlii]</a></span>
commenced, and so strangely disconcerted. To the licence of the
marchmen the failure was attributed; but the same cause ensured a safe
retreat.&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode, Godscroft, Robertson, Melville</i>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexliii" id="pagexliii">[xliii]</a></span>
<p>The wily Earl of Morton, who, after the short intervening regency
of Mar, succeeded to the supreme authority, contrived, by force or
artifice, to render the party of the king every where superior. Even
on the middle borders, he had the address to engage in his cause
the powerful, though savage and licentious, clans of Rutherford and
Turnbull, as well as the citizens of Jedburgh. He was thus enabled
to counterpoise his powerful opponents, Buccleuch and Fairnihirst,
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexliv" id="pagexliv">[xliv]</a></span>
in their own country; and, after an unsuccessful attempt to surprise
Jedburgh even these warm adherents of Mary relinquished her cause in
despair.</p>

<p>While Morton swayed the state, his attachment to Elizabeth, and the
humiliation which many of the border chiefs had undergone, contributed
to maintain good order on the marches, till James VI. himself assumed
the reigns of government.&mdash;The intervening skirmish of the Reidswire
(see the ballad under that title) was but a sudden explosion of the
rivalry and suppressed hatred of the borderers of both kingdoms. In
truth, the stern rule of Morton, and of his delegates, men unconnected
with the borders by birth, maintained in that country more strict
discipline than had ever been there exercised. Perhaps this hastened
his fall.</p>

<p>The unpopularity of Morton, acquired partly by the strict
administration of justice, and partly by avarice and severity, forced
him from the regency. In 1578, he retired, apparently, from state
affairs, to his castle of Dalkeith; which the populace, emphatically
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlv" id="pagexlv">[xlv]</a></span>
expressing their awe and dread of his person, termed the <i>Lion's
Den</i>. But Morton could not live in retirement; and, early in the
same year, the aged lion again rushed from his cavern. By a mixture of
policy and violence, he possessed himself of the fortress of Stirling,
and of the person of James. His nephew, Angus, hastened to his
assistance. Against him appeared his follower Cessford, with many of
the Homes, and the citizens of Edinburgh. Alluding to the restraint of
the king's person, they bore his effigy on their banners, with a rude
rhyme, demanding liberty or death.&mdash;<i>Birrel's Diary, ad annum</i>,
1578. The Earl of Morton marched against his foes as far as Falkirk,
and a desperate action must have ensued, but for the persuasions of
Bowes, the English ambassador. The only blood, then spilt, was in
a duel betwixt Tait, a follower of Cessford, and Johnstone, a west
border man, attending upon Angus. They fought with lances, and on
horseback, according to the fashion of the borders.&mdash;The former was
unhorsed and slain, the latter desperately wounded.&mdash;<i>Godscroft</i>,
Vol. II. p. 261. The prudence of the late regent appears to have
abandoned him, when he was decoyed into a treaty upon this occasion.
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlvi" id="pagexlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
It was not long before Morton the veteran warrior, and the crafty
statesman, was forced bend his neck to an engine of death<a name="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>, the use
of which he himself had introduced into Scotland.</p>

<p>Released from the thraldom of Morton, the king, with more than
youthful levity, threw his supreme power into the hands of Lennox and
Arran. The religion of the first, and the infamous character of the
second favourite, excited the hatred of the commons, while their
exclusive and engrossing power awakened the jealousy of the other
nobles. James, doomed to be the sport of contending factions was
seized at Stirling by the nobles, confederated in what was termed the
Raid of Ruthven. But the conspirators soon suffered their prize to
escape, and were rewarded for their enterprize by exile or death.</p>

<p>In 1585, an affray took place at a border meeting in which Lord
Russel, the Earl of Bedford's eldest son, chanced to be slain. Queen
Elizabeth imputed the guilt of this slaughter to Thomas Kerr of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlvii" id="pagexlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
Fairnihirst, instigated by Arran. Upon the imperious demand of the
English ambassador, both were committed to prison; but the minion,
Arran, was soon restored to liberty and favour; while Fairnihirst, the
dread of the English borderers and the gallant defender of Queen Mary,
died in his confinement, of a broken heart.&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode</i> p.
341.</p>

<p>The tyranny of Arran becoming daily more insupportable the exiled
lords, joined by Maxwell, Home, Bothwell, and other border chieftains,
seized the town of Stirling, which was pillaged by their disorderly
followers, invested the castle, which surrendered at discretion, and
drove the favourite from the king's council<a name="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The king, perceiving the Earl of Bothwell among the armed barons,
to whom he surrendered his person addressed him in these prophetic
words:&mdash; &quot;Francis, Francis, what moved thee to come in arms against
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlviii" id="pagexlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
thy prince, who never wronged thee? I wish thee a more quiet spirit,
else I foresee thy destruction.&quot;&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode</i>, p. 343.</p>

<p>In fact, the extraordinary enterprizes of this nobleman disturbed the
next ten years of James's reign. Francis Stuart, son to a bastard of
James V., had been invested with the titles and estates belonging
to his maternal uncle, James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, upon the
forfeiture of that infamous man; and consequently became lord of
Liddesdale, and of the castle of Hermitage.&mdash;This acquisition of power
upon the borders, where he could easily levy followers, willing to
undertake the most desperate enterprize, joined to the man's native
daring and violent spirit, rendered Bothwell the most turbulent
insurgent, that ever disturbed the tranquillity of a kingdom. During
the king's absence in Denmark, Bothwell, swayed by the superstition of
his age, had tampered with certain soothsayers and witches, by whose
pretended art he hoped to atchieve the death of his monarch. In one
of the courts of inquisition, which James delighted to hold upon the
professors of the occult sciences, some of his cousin's proceedings
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlvix" id="pagexlix">[xlix]</a></span>
were brought to light, for which he was put in ward in the castle of
Edinburgh. Burning with revenge, he broke from his confinement,
and lurked for some time upon the borders, where he hoped for the
countenance of his son-in-law, Buccleuch. Undeterred by the absence
of that chief, who, in obedience to the royal command, had prudently
retired to France, Bothwell attempted the desperate enterprize of
seizing the person of the king, while residing in his metropolis. At
the dead of night, followed by a band of borderers, he occupied the
court of the palace of Holyrood, and began to burst open the doors
of the royal apartments. The nobility, distrustful of each other, and
ignorant of the extent of the conspiracy, only endeavoured to
make good the defence of their separate lodgings; but darkness and
confusion prevented the assailants from profiting by their disunion.
Melville, who was present, gives a lively picture of the scene of
disorder, transiently illuminated by the glare of passing torches;
while the report of fire arms, the clatter of armour, the din of
hammers thundering on the gates, mingled wildly with the war-cry of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlx" id="pagexlx">[xlx]</a></span>
the borderers, who shouted incessantly, &quot;Justice! Justice! A Bothwell!
A Bothwell!&quot; The citizens of Edinburgh at length began to assemble for
the defence of their sovereign; and Bothwell was compelled to retreat,
which he did without considerable loss.&mdash;<i>Melville</i>, p. 356. A
similar attempt on the person of James, while residing at Faulkland,
also misgave; but the credit which Bothwell obtained on the borders,
by these bold and desperate enterprizes, was incredible &quot;All
Tiviotdale,&quot; says Spottiswoode, &quot;ran after him;&quot; so that he finally
obtained his object; and, at Edinburgh, in 1593, he stood before
James, an unexpected apparition, with his naked sword in his hand.
&quot;Strike!&quot; said James, with royal dignity&mdash;&quot;Strike, and end thy work!
I will not survive my dishonour.&quot; But Bothwell with unexpected
moderation, only stipulated for remission of his forfeiture, and did
not even insist on remaining at court, whence his party was shortly
expelled, by the return of the Lord Home, and his other enemies.
Incensed at this reverse, Bothwell levied a body of four hundred
cavalry, and attacked the king's guard in broad day, upon the Borough
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxi" id="pagexlxi">[xlxi]</a></span>
Moor, near Edinburgh.&mdash;The ready succour of the citizens saved James
from falling once more into the hands of his turbulent subject<a name="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>.
On a subsequent day, Bothwell met the laird of Cessford, riding near
Edinburgh, with whom he fought a single combat, which lasted for two
hours<a name="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>. But his credit was now fallen; he retreated to England,
whence he was driven by Elizabeth, and then wandered to Spain and
Italy, where he subsisted, in indigence and obscurity, on the bread
which he earned by apostatizing to the faith of Rome. So fell this
agitator of domestic broils, whose name passed into a proverb,
denoting a powerful and turbulent demagogue<a name="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxii" id="pagexlxii">[xlxii]</a></span>
<p>While these scenes were passing in the metropolis the borders were
furiously agitated by civil discord. The families of Cessford and
Fairnihirst disputed their right to the wardenry of the middle
marches, and to the provostry of Jedburgh; and William Kerr of Ancram,
a follower of the latter, was murdered by the young chief of Cessford,
at the instigation of his mother.&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode</i>, p. 383. But
this was trifling, compared to the civil war, waged on the western
frontier, between the Johnstones and Maxwells, of which there is
a minute account in the introduction to the ballad, entitled,
&quot;<i>Maxwell's Goodnight</i>.&quot; Prefixed to that termed &quot;<i>Kinmont
Willie</i>&quot; the reader will find an account of the last warden raids
performed upon the border.</p>

<p>My sketch of border history now draws to a close. The accession of
James to the English crown converted the extremity into the centre of
his kingdom.</p>

<p>The east marches of Scotland were, at this momentous period, in a
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxiii" id="pagexlxiii">[xlxiii]</a></span>
state of comparative civilization. The rich soil of Berwickshire soon
invited the inhabitants to the arts of agriculture.&mdash;Even in the days
of Lesley, the nobles and barons of the Merse differed in manners
from the other borderers, administered justice with regularity, and
abstained from plunder and depredation.&mdash;<i>De moribus Scotorum</i>,
p. 7. But, on the middle and western marches, the inhabitants were
unrestrained moss-troopers and cattle drivers, knowing no measure of
law, says Camden, but the length of their swords. The sterility of
the mountainous country, which they inhabited, offered little
encouragement to industry; and, for the long series of centuries,
which we have hastily reviewed, the hands of rapine were never there
folded in inactivity, nor the sword of violence returned to the
scabbard. Various proclamations were in vain issued for interdicting
the use of horses and arms upon the west border of England and
Scotland<a name="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxiv" id="pagexlxiv">[xlxiv]</a></span>
<p>The evil was found to require the radical cure of extirpation.
Buccleuch collected under his banners the most desperate of the border
warriors, of whom he formed a legion, for the service of the states of
Holland; who had as much reason to rejoice on their arrival upon the
continent, as Britain to congratulate herself upon their departure. It
may be presumed, that few of this corps ever returned to their native
country. The clan of Graeme, a hardy and ferocious set of freebooters
inhabiting chiefly the Debateable Land, by a very summary exertion
of authority, was transported to Ireland, and their return prohibited
under pain of death. Against other offenders, measures, equally
arbitrary, were without hesitation pursued. Numbers of border riders
were executed, without even the formality of a trial; and it is even
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxv" id="pagexlxv">[xlxv]</a></span>
said, that, in mockery of justice, assizes were held upon them after
they had suffered. For these acts of tyranny, see <i>Johnston</i>,
p. 374, 414, 39, 93. The memory of Dunbar's legal proceedings
at Jedburgh, are preserved in the proverbial phrase, <i>Jeddart
Justice</i>, which signifies, trial after execution. By this rigour
though sternly and unconscientiously exercised the border marauders
were, in the course of years, either reclaimed or exterminated; though
nearly a century elapsed ere their manners were altogether assimilated
to those of their countrymen<a name="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In these hasty sketches of border history, I have endeavoured to
select, such incidents, as may introduce to the reader the character
of the marchmen, more briefly and better than a formal essay upon
their manners. If I have been successful in the attempt, he is already
acquainted with the mixture of courage and rapacity by which they were
distinguished; and has reviewed some of the scenes in which they acted
a principal part. It is, therefore only necessary to notice, more
minutely, some of their peculiar customs and modes of life.</p>

<p>Their morality was of a singular kind. The ranpine, by which they
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxvi" id="pagexlxvi">[xlxvi]</a></span>
subsisted, they accounted lawful and honourable. Ever liable to lose
their whole substance, by an incursion of the English, on a sudden
breach of truce, they cared little to waste their time in cultivating
crops, to be reaped by their foes. Their cattle was, therefore,
their chief property; and these were nightly exposed to the southern
borderers, as rapacious and active as themselves. Hence, robbery
assumed the appearance of fair reprisal. The fatal privilege of
pursuing the marauders into their own country, for recovery of stolen
goods, led to continual skirmishes The warden also, himself frequently
the chieftain of a border horde, when redress was not instantly
granted by the opposite officer, for depredations sustained by his
district, was entitled to retaliate upon England by a warden raid.
In such cases, the moss-troopers, who crowded to his standard, found
themselves pursuing their craft under legal authority, and became the
favourites and followers of the military magistrate, whose duty it
was to have checked and suppressed them. See the curious history of
<i>Geordie Bourne, App. No. II</i>. Equally unable and unwilling to
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxvii" id="pagexlxvii">[xlxvii]</a></span>
make nice distinctions, they were not to be convinced, that what
was to-day fair booty, was to-morrow a subject of theft. National
animosity usually gave an additional stimulus to their rapacity;
although it must be owned, that their depredations extended also to
the more cultivated parts of their own country<a name="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Satchells, who lived when the old border ideas of <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i> were still in some force, endeavours to draw a very nice
distinction betwixt a freebooter and a thief; and thus sings he of the
Armstrongs:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On that border was the Armstrongs, able men;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Somewhat unruly, and very ill to tame.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would have none think that I call them thieves,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For, if I did, it would be arrant lies.</span><br />
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxviii" id="pagexlxviii">[xlxviii]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Near a border frontier, in the time of war,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's ne'er a man but he's a freebooter.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because to all men it may appear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The freebooter he is a volunteer;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the muster rolls he has no desire to stay;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he that hath transgress'd since then,</span><br />

<p></p>

<p>The inhabitants of the inland counties did not understand these subtle
distinctions. Sir David Lindsay, in the curious drama, published by
Mr Pinkerton, introduces, as one of his <i>dramatis personae, Common
Thift</i>, a borderer, who is supposed to come to Fife to steal
the Earl of Rothes' best hackney, and Lord Lindsay's brown jennet.
<i>Oppression</i> also (another personage there introduced), seems
to be connected with the borders; for, finding himself in danger, he
exclaims,&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">War God that I were sound and haill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now liftit into Liddesdail;</span><br />

<p>Sir Richard Maitland, incensed at the boldness and impunity of
the thieves of Liddesdale in his time, has attacked them with keen
iambicks. His satire, which, I suppose, had very little effect at the
time, forms No. III, of the appendix to this introduction.</p>

<p>The borderers had, in fact, little reason to regard the inland Scots
as their fellow subjects, or to respect the power of the crown.
They were frequently resigned, by express compact, to the bloody
retaliation of the English, without experiencing any assistance from
their prince, and his more immediate subjects. If they beheld him, it
was more frequently in the character of an avenging judge, than of a
protecting sovereign. They were, in truth, during the time of peace,
a kind of outcasts, against whom the united powers of England and
Scotland were often employed. Hence, the men of the borders had little
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxi" id="pagexlxxi">[xlxxi]</a></span>
attachment to the monarchs, whom they termed, in derision, the kings
of Fife and Lothian; provinces which they were not legally entitled
to inhabit<a name="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>, and which, therefore, they pillaged with as little
remorse as if they had belonged to a foreign country. This strange,
precarious, and adventurous mode of life, led by the borderers, was
not without its pleasures, and seems, in all probability, hardly so
disagreeable to us, as the monotony of regulated society must have
been to those, who had been long accustomed to a state of rapine. Well
has it been remarked, by the eloquent Burke, that the shifting tides
of fear and hope, the flight and pursuit, the peril and escape,
alternate famine and feast, of the savage and the robber, after a time
render all course of slow, steady, progressive, unvaried occupation
and the prospect only of a limited mediocrity at the end of long
labour, to the last degree tame, languid, and insipid. The interesting
nature of their exploits may be conceived from the account of Camden.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxii" id="pagexlxxii">[xlxxii]</a></span>
<p>&quot;What manner of cattle stealers they are, that inhabit these valleys
in the marches of both kingdoms, John Lesley, a Scotchman himself, and
bishop of Ross, will inform you. They sally out of their own borders,
in the night, in troops, through unfrequented bye-ways, and many
intricate windings. All the day-time, they refresh themselves and
their horses in lurking holes they had pitched upon before, till they
arrive in the dark at those places they have a design upon. As soon as
they have seized upon the booty, they, in like manner, return home in
the night, through blind ways, and fetching many a compass. The more
skilful any captain is to pass through those wild deserts, crooked
turnings, and deep precipices, in the thickest mists and darkness,
his reputation is the greater, and he is looked upon as a man of an
excellent head.&mdash;And they are so very cunning, that they seldom have
their booty taken from them, unless sometimes, when, by the help of
blood-hounds following them exactly upon the tract, they may chance to
fall into the hands of their adversaries. When being taken, they have
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxiii" id="pagexlxxiii">[xlxxiii]</a></span>
so much persuasive eloquence, and so many smooth insinuating words at
command, that if they do not move their judges, nay, and even their
adversaries (notwithstanding the severity of their natures), to
have mercy, yet they incite them to admiration and
compassion.&quot;&mdash;<i>Camden's Britannia.</i> The reader is requested to
compare this curious account, given by Lesley, with the ballad, called
<i>Hobble Noble</i><a name="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxiv" id="pagexlxxiv">[xlxxiv]</a></span>
<p>The inroads of the marchers, when stimulated only by the desire
of plunder, were never marked with cruelty, and seldom even with
bloodshed, unless in the case of opposition. They held, that property
was common to all who stood in want of it; but they abhorred and
avoided the crime of unnecessary homicide.&mdash;<i>Lesley</i>, p. 63.
This was, perhaps, partly owing to the habits of intimacy betwixt the
borderers of both kingdoms, notwithstanding their mutual hostility,
and reciprocal depredations. A natural intercourse took place between
the English and Scottish marchers, at border meetings, and during the
short intervals of peace. They met frequently at parties of the chace
and foot-ball; and it required many and strict regulations, on
both sides, to prevent them from forming intermarriages, and from
cultivating too close a degree of intimacy.&mdash;<i>Scottish Acts</i>,
1587, c. 105; <i>Wharton's Regulations, 6th Edward VI.</i> The
custom, also, of paying black-mail, or protection-rent, introduced
a connection betwixt the countries; for, a Scottish borderer, taking
black-mail from an English inhabitant, was not only himself bound to
abstain from injuring such person, but also to maintain his quarrel,
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxv" id="pagexlxxv">[xlxxv]</a></span>
and recover his property, if carried off by others. Hence, an union
arose betwixt the parties, founded upon mutual interest, which
counteracted, in many instances, the effects of national prejudice.
The similarity of their manners may be inferred from that of their
language. In an old mystery, imprinted at London, 1654, a mendicant
borderer is introduced, soliciting alms of a citizen and his wife.
To a question of the latter he replies, &quot;Savying your honour, good
maistress, I was born in Redesdale, in Northomberlande, and come of a
wight riding sirname, call'd the Robsons: gude honeste men, and true,
savyng a little shiftynge for theyr livyng; God help them, silly pure
men.&quot; The wife answers, &quot;What doest thou here, in this countrie? me
thinke thou art a Scot by thy tongue.&quot; <i>Beggar</i>&mdash;&quot;Trowe me
never mair then, good deam; I had rather be hanged in a withie of
a cow-taile, for thei are ever fare and fase.&quot;&mdash;<i>Appendix
to Johnstone's Sad Shepherd</i>, 1783. p. 188. From the wife's
observation, as well as from the dialect of the beggar, we may infer,
that there was little difference between the Northumbrian and the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxvi" id="pagexlxxvi">[xlxxvi]</a></span>
border Scottish; a circumstance interesting in itself, and decisive of
the occasional friendly intercourse among the marchmen. From all those
combining circumstances arose the lenity of the borderers in their
incursions and the equivocal moderation which they sometimes observed
towards each other, in open war<a name="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxvii" id="pagexlxxvii">[xlxxvii]</a></span>
<p>This humanity and moderation was, on certain occasions, entirely laid
aside by the borderers. In the case of deadly feud, either against an
Englishman, or against any neighbouring tribe, the whole force of the
offended clan was bent to avenge the death of any of their number.
Their vengeance not only vented itself upon the homicide and his
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxviii" id="pagexlxxviii">[xlxxviii]</a></span>
family, but upon all his kindred, on his whole tribe; on every one,
in fine, whose death or ruin could affect him with
regret.&mdash;<i>Lesley</i>, p. 63; <i>Border Laws</i>, <i>passim</i>;
<i>Scottish Acts</i>, 1594, c. 231. The reader will find, in the
following collection, many allusions to this infernal custom, which
always overcame the marcher's general reluctance to shed human, blood,
and rendered him remorselessly savage.</p>

<p>For fidelity to their word, Lesley ascribes high praise to the
inhabitants of the Scottish frontier. When an instance happened to
the contrary, the injured person, at the first border meeting, rode
through the field, displaying a glove (the pledge of faith) upon the
point of his lance, and proclaiming the perfidy of the person, who had
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxiv" id="pagexlxxix">[xlxxix]</a></span>
broken his word. So great was the indignation of the assembly against
the perjured criminal, that he was often slain by his own clan, to
wipe out the disgrace he had brought on them. In the same spirit
of confidence, it was not unusual to behold the victors, after an
engagement, dismiss their prisoners upon parole, who never failed
either to transmit the stipulated ransom, or to surrender themselves
to bondage, if unable to do so. But the virtues of a barbarous
people, being founded not upon moral principle, but upon the dreams of
superstition, or the capricious dictates of antient custom, can seldom
be uniformly relied on. We must not, therefore, be surprised to find
these very men, so true to their word in general, using, upon other
occasions, various resources of cunning and chicane, against which the
border laws were in vain directed.</p>

<p>The immediate rulers of the borders were the chiefs of the different
clans, who exercised over their respective septs a dominion, partly
patriarchal, and partly feudal. The latter bond of adherence was,
however, the more slender; for, in the acts regulating the borders,
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxx" id="pagexlxxx">[xlxxx]</a></span>
we find repeated mention of &quot;Clannes having captaines and chieftaines,
whom on they depend, oft-times against the willes of their
landeslordes.&quot;&mdash;<i>Stat.</i> 1587, c. 95, <i>and the Roll thereto
annexed</i>. Of course, these laws looked less to the feudal superior,
than to the chieftain of the name, for the restraint of the disorderly
tribes; and it is repeatedly enacted, that the head of the clan should
be first called upon to deliver those of his sept, who should commit
any trespass, and that, on his failure to do so, he should be liable
to the injured party in full redress. <i>Ibidem</i>, and <i>Stat.</i>
1594, c. 231. By the same statutes, the chieftains and landlords,
presiding over border clans, were obliged to find caution, and to
grant hostages, that they would subject themselves to the due course
of law. Such clans, as had no chieftain of sufficient note to enter
bail for their quiet conduct, became broken men, outlawed to both
nations.</p>

<p>From these enactments, the power of the border chieftains may be
conceived; for it had been hard and useless to have punished them
for the trespasses of their tribes, unless they possessed over them
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxi" id="pagexlxxxi">[xlxxxi]</a></span>
unlimited authority. The abode of these petty princes by no means
corresponded to the extent of their power. We do not find, on the
Scottish borders, the splendid and extensive baronial castles, which
graced and defended the opposite frontier. The gothic grandeur of
Alnwick, of Raby, and of Naworth, marks the wealthier and more secure
state of the English nobles. The Scottish chieftain, however extensive
his domains, derived no advantage, save from such parts as he could
himself cultivate or occupy. Payment of rent was hardly known on the
borders, till after the union<a name="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>. All that the landlord could gain,
from those residing upon his estate, was their personal service in
battle, their assistance in labouring the land retained in his natural
possession, some petty quit-rents, of a nature resembling the feudal
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxii" id="pagexlxxxii">[xlxxxii]</a></span>
casualties, and perhaps a share in the spoil which they acquired by
rapine<a name="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>. This, with his herds of cattle and of sheep, and with the
<i>black mail</i>, which he exacted from his neighbours, constituted
the revenue of the chieftain; and, from funds so precarious, he
could rarely spare sums to expend in strengthening or decorating his
habitation. Another reason is found in the Scottish mode of warfare.
It was early discovered, that the English surpassed their neighbours
in the arts of assaulting or defending fortified places. The policy of
the Scottish, therefore, deterred them from erecting upon the borders
buildings of such extent and strength, as, being once taken by the
foe, would have been capable of receiving a permanent garrison<a name="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>. To
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxiii" id="pagexlxxxiii">[xlxxxiii]</a></span>
themselves, the woods and hills of their country were pointed out,
by the great Bruce, as their safest bulwarks; and the maxim of the
Douglasses, that &quot;it was better to hear the lark sing, than the mouse
cheep,&quot; was adopted by every border chief. For these combined
reasons, the residence of the chieftain was commonly a large square
battlemented<a name="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> tower, called a <i>keep</i>, or <i>peel</i>; placed
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxiv" id="pagexlxxxiv">[xlxxxiv]</a></span>
on a precipice, or on the banks of a torrent, and, if the ground would
permit, surrounded by a moat. In short, the situation of a border
house, surrounded by woods, and rendered almost inaccessible by
torrents, by rocks, or by morasses, sufficiently indicated the
pursuits and apprehensions of its inhabitant.&mdash;&quot;<i>Locus horroris
et vastae solitudinis, aptus ad praedam, habilis ad rapinam,
habitatoribus suis lapis erat offensiones et petra scandali, utpote
qui stipendiis suis minime contenti totum de alieno parum de suo
possidebant&mdash;totius provinciae spolium</i>.&quot; No wonder, therefore,
that James V., on approaching the castle of Lochwood, the antient seat
of the Johnstones, is said to have exclaimed, &quot;that he who built it
must have been a knave in his heart.&quot; An outer wall, with some slight
fortifications, served as a protection for the cattle at night. The
walls of these fortresses were of an immense thickness, and they could
easily be defended against any small force; more especially, as, the
rooms being vaulted, each story formed a separate lodgement, capable
of being held out for a considerable time. On such occasions, the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxv" id="pagexlxxxv">[xlxxxv]</a></span>
usual mode, adopted by the assailants, was to expel the defenders,
by setting fire to wet straw in the lower apartments. But the border
chieftains seldom chose to abide in person a siege of this nature; and
I have not observed a single instance of a distinguished baron made
prisoner in his own house<a name="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>.&mdash;<i>Patten's Expedition</i>, p. 35. The
common people resided in paltry huts, about the safety of which
they were little anxious, as they contained nothing of value. On the
approach of a superior force, they unthatched them, to prevent
their being burned, and then abandoned them to the foe.&mdash;<i>Stowe's
Chronicle</i>, p. 665. Their only treasures were, a fleet and active
horse, with the ornaments which their rapine had procured for the
females of their family, of whose gay appearance the borderers were
vain.</p>

<p>Some rude monuments occur upon the borders, the memorial of ancient
valour. Such is the cross at Milholm, on the banks of the Liddel,
said to have been erected in memory of the chief of the Armstrongs,
murdered treacherously by Lord Soulis, while feasting in Hermitage
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxvi" id="pagexlxxxvi">[xlxxxvi]</a></span>
castle. Such also, a rude stone, now broken, and very much defaced,
placed upon a mount on the lands of Haughhead, near the junction
of the Kale and Teviot. The inscription records the defence made by
Hobbie Hall, a man of great strength and courage against an attempt
by the powerful family of Ker, to possess themselves of his small
estate<a name="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The same simplicity marked their dress and arms. Patten observes,
that in battle the laird could not be distinguished from the serf: all
wearing the same coat armour, called a jack, and the baron being
only distinguished by his sleeves of mail, and his head-piece. The
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxvii" id="pagexlxxxvii">[xlxxxvii]</a></span>
borderers, in general, acted as light cavalry; riding horses of a
small size, but astonishingly nimble, and trained to move, by short
bounds, through the morasses with which Scotland abounds. Their
offensive weapons were, a lance of uncommon length; a sword, either
two-handed, or of the modern light size; sometimes a species of
battle-axe, called a Jedburgh-staff; and, latterly, dags, or pistols.
Although so much accustomed to act on horseback, that they held it
even mean to appear otherwise, the marchmen occasionally acted as
infantry; nor were they inferior to the rest of Scotland in forming
that impenetrable phalanx of spears, whereof it is said, by an English
historian, that &quot;sooner shall a bare finger pierce through the skin of
an angry hedge-hog, than any one encounter the brunt of their pikes.&quot;
At the battle of Melrose, for example, Buccleuch's army fought upon
foot. But the habits of the borderers fitted them particularly
to distinguish themselves as light cavalry; and hence the name of
<i>prickers and hobylers</i>, so frequently applied to them. At the
blaze of their beacon fires, they were wont to assemble ten thousand
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxviii" id="pagexlxxxviii">[xlxxxviii]</a></span>
horsemen in the course of a single day. Thus rapid in their warlike
preparations, they were alike ready for attack and defence. Each
individual carried his own provisions, consisting of a small bag of
oatmeal, and trusted to plunder, or the chace, for ekeing out his
precarious meal. Beaug&eacute; remarks, that nothing surprised the Scottish
cavalry so much as to see their French auxiliaries encumbered with
baggage-waggons, and attended by commissaries. Before joining battle,
it seems to have been the Scottish practice to set fire to the litter
of their camp, while, under cover of the smoke, the <i>hobylers</i>,
or border cavalry, executed their manoeuvres.&mdash;There is a curious
account of the battle of Mitton, fought in the year 1319, in a
valuable MS. <i>Chronicle of England</i>, in the collection of the
Marquis of Douglas, from which this stratagem seems to have decided
the engagement. &quot;In meyn time, while the wer thus lastyd, the kynge
went agane into Skotlonde, that hitte was wonder for to wette, and
bysechyd the towne of Barwick; but the Skottes went over the water of
Sold, that was iii myle from the hoste, and prively they stole awaye
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexlxxxix" id="pagexlxxxix">[xlxxxix]</a></span>
be nyghte, and come into England, and robbed and destroyed all that
they myght, and spared no manner thing til that they come to Yorke.
And, whan the Englischemen, that wer left att home, herd this tiding,
all tho that myght well travell, so well monkys and priestis, and
freres, and chanouns, and seculars, come and met with the Skottes
at Mytone of Swale, the xii day of October. Allas, for sorow for
the Englischemen! housbondmen, that could nothing in wer, ther were
quelled and drenchyd in an arm of the see. And hyr chyftaines, Sir
William Milton, ersch-biishop of Yorke, and the abbot of Selby, with
her stedes, fled and com into Yorke; and that was her owne folye that
they had that mischaunce; for the passyd the water of Swale, and the
Skottes set on fiir three stalkes of hey, and the smoke thereof was
so huge, that the Englischemen might nott se the Scottes; and whan the
Englischemen were gon over the water, tho cam the Skottes, with hir
wyng, in maner of a sheld, and come toward the Englischemen in ordour.
And the Englischemen fled for unnethe they had any use of armes,
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexc" id="pagexc">[xc]</a></span>
for the kyng had hem al almost lost att the sege of Barwick. And the
Scotsmen <i>hobylers</i> went betwene the brigge and the Englischemen;
and when the gret hoste them met, the Englischemen fled between the
<i>hobylers</i> and the gret hoste; and the Englischemen were ther
quelled, and he that myght wend over the water were saved, but many
were drowned. Alas! for there were slayn many men of religion,
and seculars, and pristis, and clerks, and with much sorwe the
erschbischope scaped from the Skottes; and, therefore, the Skottes
called that battell the <i>White Battell</i>&quot;</p>

<p>For smaller predatory expeditions, the borderers had signals, and
places of rendezvous, peculiar to each tribe. If the party set forward
before all the members had joined, a mark, cut in the turf, or on the
bark of a tree, pointed out to the stragglers the direction which the
main body had pursued<a name="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexci" id="pagexci">[xci]</a></span>
<p>Their warlike convocations were, also, frequently disguised, under
pretence of meetings for the purpose of sport. The game of foot-ball,
in particular which was anciently, and still continues to be, a
favourite border sport, was the means of collecting together large
bodies of moss-troopers, previous to any military exploit. When Sir
Robert Carey was warden of the east marches, the knowledge that there
was a great match of foot-ball at Kelso, to be frequented by the
principal Scottish riders, was sufficient to excite his vigilance
and his apprehension<a name="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>. Previous also to the murder of Sir John
Carmichael (see Notes on the <i>Raid of the Reidswire</i>,) it
appeared at the trial of the perpetrators that they had assisted at a
grand foot-ball meeting, where the crime was concerted.</p>

<p>Upon the religion of the borderers there can very little be said.
We have already noticed, that they remained attached to the Roman
Catholic faith rather longer than the rest of Scotland. This probably
arose from a total indifference upon the subject; for, we no where
find in their character the respect for the church, which is a marked
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexcii" id="pagexcii">[xcii]</a></span>
feature of that religion. In 1528, Lord Dacre complains heavily to
Cardinal Wolsey, that, having taken a notorious freebooter, called
Dyk Irwen, the brother and friends of the outlaw had, in retaliation,
seized a man of some property, and a relation of Lord Dacre, called
Jeffrey Middleton, as he returned from a pilgrimage to St. Ninian's,
in Galloway; and that, notwithstanding the sanctity of his character,
as a <i>true pilgrim</i>, and the Scottish monarch's safe conduct,
they continued to detain him in their fastnesses, until he should
redeem the said arrant thief, Dyk Irwen. The abbeys, which were
planted upon the border, neither seem to have been much respected by
the English, nor by the Scottish barons. They were repeatedly burned
by the former, in the course of the border wars, and by the latter
they seem to have been regarded chiefly as the means of endowing a
needy relation, or the subject of occasional plunder. Thus, Andrew
Home of Fastcastle, about 1488, attempted to procure a perpetual feu
of certain possessions belonging to the abbey of Coldinghame; and
being baffled, by the king bestowing that opulent benefice upon
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexciii" id="pagexciii">[xciii]</a></span>
the royal chapel at Stirling, the Humes and Hepburns started into
rebellion; asserting, that the priory should be conferred upon some
younger son of their families, according to ancient custom. After the
fatal battle of Flodden, one of the Kerrs testified his contempt for
clerical immunities and privileges, by expelling from his house the
abbot of Kelso. These bickerings betwixt the clergy and the barons
were usually excited by disputes about their temporal interest. It
was common for the churchmen to grant lands in feu to the neighbouring
gentlemen, who, becoming their vassals, were bound to assist and
protect them<a name="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>. But, as the possessions and revenues of the
benefices became thus intermixed with those of the laity, any attempts
rigidly to enforce the claims of the church were usually attended
by the most scandalous disputes. A petty warfare was carried on for
years, betwixt James, abbot of Dryburgh, and the family of Halliburton
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexciv" id="pagexciv">[xciv]</a></span>
of Mertoun, or Newmains, who held some lands from that abbey. These
possessions were, under various pretexts, seized and laid waste by
both parties; and some bloodshed took place in the contest, betwixt
the lay vassals and their spiritual superior. The matter was, at
length, thought of sufficient importance to be terminated by a
reference to his majesty; whose decree arbitral, dated at Stirling,
the 8th of May, 1535, proceeds thus: &quot;Whereas we, having been advised
and knowing the said gentlemen, the Halliburtons, to be leal and true
honest men, long servants unto the saide abbeye, for the saide landis,
stout men at armes, and goode borderers against Ingland; and doe
therefore decree and ordaine, that they sail be re-possess'd, and
bruik and enjoy the landis and steedings they had of the said abbeye,
paying the use and wonte: and that they sall be goode servants to the
said venerabil father, like as they and their predecessours were to
the said venerabil father, and his predecessours, and he a good
master to them<a name="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>.&quot; It is unnecessary to detain the reader with other
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexc" id="pagexcv">[xcv]</a></span>
instances of the discord, which prevailed anciently upon the borders,
betwixt the spiritual shepherd and his untractable flock.</p>

<p>The reformation was late of finding its way into the border wilds;
for, while the religious and civil dissentions were at the height in
1568, Drury writes to Cecil,&mdash;&quot;Our trusty neighbours of Teviotdale are
holden occupied only to attend to the pleasure and calling of their
own heads, to make some diversion in this matter.&quot; The influence of
the reformed preachers, among the borders, seems also to have been but
small; for, upon all occasions of dispute with the kirk, James VI. was
wont to call in their assistance. <i>Calderwood</i>, p. 129.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexcvi" id="pagexcvi">[xcvi]</a></span>
<p>We learn from a curious passage in the life of Richard Cameron,
a fanatical preacher during the time of what is called &quot;the
persecution,&quot; that some of the borderers retained to a late period
their indifference about religious matters. After having been licensed
at Haughhead, in Teviotdale, he was, according to his biographer, sent
first to preach in Annandale. &quot;He said, 'how can I go there? I know
what sort of people they are.' 'But,' Mr. Welch said, 'go your way,
Ritchie, and set the fire of hell to their tails.' He went; and, the
first day, he preached upon that text, <i>Home shall I put thee among
the children, &amp;c.</i>. In the application he said, 'Put you among the
children! the offspring of thieves and robbers! we have all heard of
Annandale thieves.' Some of them got a merciful cast that day,
and told afterwards, that it was the first field meeting they ever
attended, and that they went out of mere curiosity, to see a minister
preach in a tent, and people sit on the ground.&quot; <i>Life of Richard
Cameron</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexcvii" id="pagexcvii">[xcvii]</a></span>
<p>Cleland, an enthusiastic Cameronian, lieutenant-colonel of the
regiment levied after the Revolution from among that wild and
fanatical sect, claims to the wandering preachers of his tribe
the merit of converting the borderers. He introduces a cavalier,
haranguing the Highlanders, and ironically thus guarding them against
the fanatic divines:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dayly experience makes it appear;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For instance, lately on the borders,</span><br />

<p>The poet of the whigs might exaggerate the success of their teachers;
yet, it must be owned, that their doctrine of insubordination, joined
to their vagrant and lawless habits, was calculated strongly to
conciliate their border hearers.</p>

<p>But, though the church, in the border counties, attracted little
veneration, no part of Scotland teemed with superstitious fears and
observances more than they did. &quot;The Dalesmen<a name="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>,&quot; says Lesley,
&quot;never count their beads with such earnestness as when they set out
upon a predatory expedition.&quot; Penances, the composition betwixt guilt
and conscience, were also frequent upon the borders. Of this we have
a record in many bequests to the church, and in some more lasting
monuments; such as the Tower of Repentance in Dumfries-shire,
and, according to vulgar tradition, the church of Linton<a name="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>, in
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexcviii" id="pagexcviii">[xciiii]</a></span>
Roxburghshire. In the appendix to this introduction. No. IV., the
reader will find a curious league, or treaty of peace, betwixt two
hostile clans, by which the heads of each became bound to make the
four pilgrimages of Scotland, for the benefit of the souls of those
of the opposite clan, who had fallen in the feud. These were
superstitions, flowing immediately from the nature of the Catholic
religion: but there was, upon the border, no lack of others of a more
general nature. Such was the universal belief in spells, of which some
traces may yet remain in the wild parts of the country. These were
common in the time of the learned Bishop Nicolson, who derives
them from the time of the Pagan Danes. &quot;This conceit was the more
heightened, by reflecting upon the natural superstition of our
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagexcix" id="pagexcix">[xcix]</a></span>
borderers at this day, who were much better acquainted with, and
do more firmly believe, their old legendary stories, of fairies and
witches, than the articles of their creed. And to convince me, yet
farther, that they are not utter strangers to the black art of their
forefathers, I met with a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who shewed
me a book of spells, and magical receipts, taken, two or three days
before, in the pocket of one of our moss-troopers; wherein, among many
other conjuring feats, was prescribed, a certain remedy for an ague,
by applying a few barbarous characters to the body of the party
distempered. These, methought, were very near a-kin to Wormius's
<i>Ram Runer</i>, which, he says, differed wholly in figure and shape
from the common <i>runae</i>. For, though he tells us, that these
<i>Ram Runer</i> were so called, <i>Eo quod molestias, dolores,
morbosque hisce infligere inimicis soliti sunt magi</i>; yet his great
friend, Arng. Jonas, more to our purpose, says, that&mdash;<i>His etiam usi
sunt ad benefaciendum, juvandum, medicandum tam animi quam corporis
morbis; atque ad ipsos cacodaemones pellendos et fugandos</i>. I shall
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagec" id="pagec">[c]</a></span>
not trouble you with a draught of this spell, because I have not yet
had an opportunity of learning whether it may not be an ordinary one,
and to be met with, among others of the same nature, in Paracelsus,
or Cornelius Agrippa.&quot;&mdash;<i>Letter from Bishop Nicolson to Mr. Walker;
vide Camden's Britannia, Cumberland</i>. Even in the editor's younger
days, he can remember the currency of certain spells, for curing
sprains, burns, or dislocations, to which popular credulity ascribed
unfailing efficacy<a name="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>. Charms, however, against spiritual enemies,
were yet more common than those intended to cure corporeal complaints.
This is not surprising, as a fantastic remedy well suited an imaginary
disease.</p>

<p>There were, upon the borders, many consecrated wells, for resorting
to which the people's credulity is severely censured, by a worthy
physician of the seventeenth century; who himself believed in a
<span class="newpage"><a name="pageci" id="pageci">[ci]</a></span>
shower of living herrings having fallen near Dumfries. &quot;Many run
superstitiously to other wells, and there obtain, as they imagine,
health and advantage; and there they offer bread and cheese, or money,
by throwing them into the well.&quot; In another part of the MS. occurs the
following passage. &quot;In the bounds of the lands of Eccles, belonging to
a lyneage of the name of Maitland, there is a loch called the Dowloch,
of old resorted to with much superstition, as medicinal both for men
and beasts, and that with such ceremonies, as are <i>shrewdly</i>
suspected to have been begun with witchcraft, and increased afterward
by magical directions: For, burying of a cloth, or somewhat that did
relate to the bodies of men and women, and a shackle, or teather,
belonging to cow or horse; and these being cast into the loch, if they
did float, it was taken for a good omen of recovery, and a part of
the water carried to the patient, though to remote places, without
saluting or speaking to any they met by the way; but, if they did
sink, the recovery of the party was hopeless. This custom was of late
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecii" id="pagecii">[cii]</a></span>
much curbed and restrained; but since the discovery of many medicinal
fountains near to the place, the vulgar, holding that it may be as
medicinal as these are, at this time begin to re-assume their former
practice.&quot;&mdash;<i>Account of Presbytery of Penpont, in Macfarlane's
MSS.</i></p>

<p>The idea, that the spirits of the deceased return to haunt the place,
where on earth they have suffered or have rejoiced, is, as Dr. Johnson
has observed, common to the popular creed of all nations The just and
noble sentiment, implanted in our bosoms by the Deity, teaches us,
that we shall not slumber for ever, as the beasts that perish.&mdash;Human
vanity, or credulity, chequers, with its own inferior and base
colours, the noble prospect, which is alike held out to us by
philosophy and by religion. We feel, according to the ardent
expression of the poet, that we shall not wholly die; but from hence
we vainly and weakly argue, that the same scenes, the same passions,
shall delight and actuate the disembodied spirit, which affected it
while in its tenement of clay. Hence the popular belief, that the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pageciii" id="pageciii">[ciii]</a></span>
soul haunts the spot where the murdered body is interred; that its
appearances are directed to bring down vengeance on its murderers; or
that, having left its terrestrial form in a distant clime, it glides
before its former friends, a pale spectre, to warn them of its
decease. Such tales, the foundation of which is an argument from our
present feelings to those of the spiritual world, form the broad
and universal basis of the popular superstition regarding departed
spirits; against which reason has striven in vain, and universal
experience has offered a disregarded testimony. These legends are
peculiarly acceptable to barbarous tribes; and, on the borders,
they were received with most unbounded faith. It is true, that these
supernatural adversaries were no longer opposed by the sword and
battle-axe, as among the unconverted Scandinavians. Prayers, spells,
and exorcisms, particularly in the Greek and Hebrew languages, were
the weapons of the borderers, or rather of their priests and cunning
men, against their a&euml;rial enemy<a name="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>. The belief in ghosts, which has
<span class="newpage"><a name="pageciv" id="pageciv">[civ]</a></span>
been well termed the last lingering phantom of superstition, still
maintains its ground upon the borders.</p>
<br />
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecv" id="pagecv">[cv]</a></span>
<p>It is unnecessary to mention the superstitious belief in witchcraft,
which gave rise to so much cruelty and persecution during the
seventeenth century. There were several executions upon the borders
for this imaginary crime, which was usually tried, not by the ordinary
judges, but by a set of country gentlemen, acting under commission
from the privy council<a name="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Besides these grand articles of superstitious belief, the creed of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecvi" id="pagecvi">[cvi]</a></span>
the borderers admitted the existence of sundry classes of subordinate
spirits, to whom were assigned peculiar employments. The chief of
these were the Fairies, concerning whom the reader will find a long
dissertation, in Volume Second. The Brownie formed a class of beings,
distinct in habit and disposition from the freakish and mischievous
elves. He was meagre, shaggy, and wild in his appearance. Thus,
Cleland, in his satire against the Highlanders, compares them to</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Faunes, or <i>Brownies</i>, if ye will,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or satyres come from Atlas hill.&quot;</span><br />

<p>In the day time, he lurked in remote recesses of the old houses which
he delighted to haunt; and, in the night, sedulously employed himself
in discharging any laborious task which he thought might be acceptable
to the family, to whose service he had devoted himself. His name is
probably derived from the <i>Portuni</i>, whom Gervase of Tilbury
describes thus: &quot;<i>Ecce enim in Anglia daemones quosdam habent,
daemones, inquam, nescio dixerim, an secretae et ignotae generationis
effigies, quos Galli Neptunos, Angli Portunos nominant. Istis insitum
est quod simplicitatem fortunatonum</i> <i>colonorum amplectuntur, et
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecvii" id="pagecvii">[cvii]</a></span>
cum nocturnas propter domesticas operas agunt vigilias, subito clausis
januis ad ignem califiunt, et ranunculus ex sinu projectas, prunis
impositas concedunt, senili vultu, facie corrugata, statura pusilli,
dimidium pollicis non habentes. Panniculis consertis induuntur, et si
quid gestandum in domo fuerit, aut onerosi opens agendum, ad operandum
se jungunt citius humana facilitate expediunt. Id illis insitum est,
ut obsequi possint et obesse non possint</i>.&quot;&mdash;Otia. Imp. p. 980. In
every respect, saving only the feeding upon frogs, which was probably
an attribute of the Gallic spirits alone, the above description
corresponds with that of the Scottish Brownie. But the latter,
although, like Milton's lubbar fiend, he loves to stretch himself
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecviii" id="pagecviii">[cviii]</a></span>
by the fire<a name="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>, does not drudge from the hope of recompence. On the
contrary, so delicate is his attachment, that the offer of reward,
but particularly of food, infallibly occasions his disappearance for
ever<a name="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>. We learn from Olaus Magnus, that spirits, somewhat similar
in their operations to the Brownie, were supposed to haunt the Swedish
mines. The passage, in the translation of 1658, runs thus: &quot;This
is collected in briefe, that in northerne kingdomes there are great
armies of devils, that have their services, which they perform with
the inhabitants of these countries: but they are most frequent in
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecix" id="pagecix">[cix]</a></span>
rocks and mines, where they break, cleave, and make them hollow: which
also thrust in pitchers and buckets, and carefully fit wheels and
screws, whereby they are drawn upwards; and they shew themselves to
the labourers, when they list, like phantasms and ghosts.&quot; It seems no
improbable conjecture, that the Brownie is a legitimate descendant of
the <i>Lar Familiaris</i> of the ancients.</p>

<p>A being, totally distinct from those hitherto mentioned, is the Bogle,
or Goblin; a freakish spirit, who delights rather to perplex and
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecx" id="pagecx">[cx]</a></span>
frighten mankind; than either to serve, or seriously to hurt, them.
This is the <i>Esprit Follet</i> of the French; and <i>Puck</i>, or
<i>Robin Goodfellow</i>, though enlisted by Shakespeare among the
fairy band of <i>Oberon</i>, properly belongs to this class of
phantoms. <i>Shellycoat</i>, a spirit, who resides in the waters, and
has given his name to many a rock and stone upon the Scottish coast,
belongs also to the class of bogles<a name="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>. When he appeared, he seemed
to be decked with marine productions, and, in particular with shells,
whose clattering announced his approach. From this circumstance he
derived his name. He may, perhaps, be identified with the goblin
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxi" id="pagecxi">[cxi]</a></span>
of the northern English, which, in the towns and cities, Durham and
Newcastle for example had the name of <i>Barquest</i>; but, in the
country villages, was more frequently termed <i>Brag</i>. He usually
ended his mischievous frolics with a horse-laugh.</p>

<p><i>Shellycoat</i> must not be confounded with <i>Kelpy</i>, a water
spirit also, but of a much more powerful and malignant nature. His
attributes have been the subject of a poem in Lowland Scottish, by the
learned Dr. Jamieson of Edinburgh, which adorns the third volume of
this collection. Of <i>Kelpy</i>, therefore, it is unnecessary to say
any thing at present.</p>

<p>Of all these classes of spirits it may be, in general observed, that
their attachment was supposed to be local, and not personal. They
haunted the rock, the stream, the ruined castle, without regard to
the persons or families to whom the property belonged. Hence, they
differed entirely from that species of spirits, to whom, in the
Highlands, is ascribed the guardianship, or superintendance of a
particular clan, or family of distinction; and who, perhaps yet more
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxii" id="pagecxii">[cxii]</a></span>
than the Brownie, resemble the classic household gods. Thus, in an
MS. history of Moray, we are informed, that the family of Gurlinbeg is
haunted by a spirit, called <i>Garlin Bodacher</i>; that of the baron
of Kinchardin, by <i>Lamhdearg</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>, or Red-hand, a spectre, one
of whose hands is as red as blood; that of Tullochgorm, by <i>May
Moulach</i>, a female figure, whose left hand and arm were covered
with hair, who is also mentioned in <i>Aubrey's Miscellanies</i>,
pp. 211, 212, as a familiar attendant upon the elan Grant. These
superstitions were so ingrafted in the popular creed, that the
clerical synods and presbyteries were wont to take cognizance of
them<a name="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxiii" id="pagecxiii">[cxiii]</a></span>
<p>Various other superstitions, regarding magicians, spells, prophecies,
&amp;c., will claim our attention in the progress of this work. For the
present, therefore taking the advice of an old Scottish rhymer, let us</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Leave bogles, brownies, gyre carlinges, and ghaists<a name="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>.&quot;</span><br />
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Flyting of Polwart and Montgomery</i>.</span><br />

<p>The domestic economy of the borderers next engages our attention. That
the revenue of the chieftain should be expended in rude hospitality,
was the natural result of his situation. His wealth consisted chiefly
in herds of cattle, which were consumed by the kinsmen, vassals, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxiv" id="pagecxiv">[cix]</a></span>
followers, who aided him to acquire and to protect them<a name="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>. We
learn from Lesley, that the borderers were temperate in the use of
intoxicating liquors, and we are therefore left to conjecture how they
occupied the time, when winter, or when accident, confined them to
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxv" id="pagecxv">[cxv]</a></span>
their habitations. The little learning, which existed in the middle
ages, glimmered a dim and a dying flame in the religious houses;
and even in the sixteenth century, when its beams became more widely
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxvi" id="pagecxvi">[cxvi]</a></span>
diffused, they were far from penetrating the recesses of the border
mountains. The tales of tradition, the song, with the pipe or harp of
the minstrel, were probably the sole resources against <i>ennui</i>,
during the short intervals of repose from military adventure.</p>

<p>This brings us to the more immediate subject of the present
publication.</p>

<p>Lesley, who dedicates to the description of border manners a chapter,
which we have already often quoted, notices particularly the taste of
the marchmen for music and ballad poetry. &quot;<i>Placent admodum sibi sua
musica, et rythmicis suis cantionibus, quas de majorum suorum gestis,
aut ingeniosis predandi precandive stratagematis ipsi confingunt</i>.
&quot;&mdash;Leslaeus, <i>in capitulo de moribus eorum, qui Scotiae limites
Angliam versus incolunt</i>. The more rude and wild the state of
society, the more general and violent is the impulse received from
poetry and music. The muse, whose effusions are the amusement of
a very small part of a polished nation, records, in the lays
of inspiration, the history the laws, the very religion, of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxvii" id="pagecxvii">[cxvii]</a></span>
savages.&mdash;Where the pen and the press are wanting, the low of numbers
impresses upon the memory of posterity, the deeds and sentiments of
their forefathers. Verse is naturally connected with music; and, among
a rude people, the union is seldom broken. By this natural alliance,
the lays, &quot;steeped in the stream of harmony,&quot; are more easily retained
by the reciter, and produce upon his audience a more impressive
effect. Hence, there has hardly been found to exist a nation so
brutishly rude, as not to listen with enthusiasm to the songs of their
bards, recounting the exploits of their forefathers, recording their
laws and moral precepts, or hymning the praises of their deities. But,
where the feelings are frequently stretched to the highest pitch,
by the vicissitudes of a life of danger and military adventure, this
predisposition of a savage people, to admire their own rude poetry and
music, is heightened, and its tone becomes peculiarly determined. It
is not the peaceful Hindu at his loom, it is not the timid Esquimaux
in his canoe, whom we must expect to glow at the war song of Tyrtaeus.
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxviii" id="pagecxviii">[cxviii]</a></span>
The music and the poetry of each country must keep pace with their
usual tone of mind, as well as with the state of society.</p>

<p>The morality of their compositions is determined by the same
circumstances. Those themes are necessarily chosen by the bard, which
regard the favourite exploits of the hearers; and he celebrates only
those virtues, which from infancy he has been taught to admire. Hence,
as remarked by Lesley, the music and songs of the borders were of
a military nature, and celebrated the valour and success of their
predatory expeditions. Razing, like Shakespeare's pirate, the eighth
commandment from the decalogue, the minstrels praised their chieftains
for the very exploits, against which the laws of the country denounced
a capital doom.&mdash;An outlawed freebooter was to them a more interesting
person, than the King of Scotland exerting his power to punish his
depredations; and, when the characters are contrasted, the latter is
always represented as a ruthless and sanguinary tyrant.&mdash;Spenser's
description of the bards of Ireland applies in some degree, to our
ancient border poets. &quot;There is, among the Irish, a certain kinde
of people, called bardes, which are to them instead of poets; whose
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxix" id="pagecxix">[cxix]</a></span>
profession is to set forth the praises or dispraises of men, in their
poems or rhymes; the which are had in such high regard or esteem
amongst them, that none dare displease them, for fear of running into
reproach through their offence, and to be made infamous in the mouths
of all men; for their verses are taken up with a general applause,
and usually sung at all feasts and meetings, by certain other persons,
whose proper function that is, who also receive, for the same, great
rewardes and reputation amongst them.&quot; Spenser, having bestowed due
praise upon the poets, who sung the praises of the good and virtuous,
informs us, that the bards, on the contrary, &quot;seldom use to chuse unto
themselves the doings of good men for the arguments of their poems;
but whomsoever they finde to be most licentious of life, most bold and
lawless in his doings, most dangerous and desperate in all parts of
disobedience, and rebellious disposition, him they set up and glorify
in their rhythmes; him they praise to the people, and to young men
make an example to follow.&quot;&mdash;<i>Eudoxus</i>&mdash;&quot;I marvail what kind of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxx" id="pagecxx">[cxx]</a></span>
speeches they can find, or what faces they can put on, to praise such
bad persons, as live so lawlessly and licentiously upon stealths and
spoyles, as most of them do; or how they can think, that any good
mind will applaud or approve the same.&quot; In answer to this question,
<i>Irenaeus</i>, after remarking the giddy and restless disposition of
the ill educated youth of Ireland, which made them prompt to receive
evil counsel, adds, that such a person, &quot;if he shall find any to
praise him, and to give him any encouragement, as those bards and
rhythmers do, for little reward, or a share of a stolen cow<a name="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>, then
waxeth he most insolent, and half-mad, with the love of himself and
his own lewd deeds. And as for words to set forth such lewdness, it
is not hard for them to give a goodly and painted show thereunto,
borrowed even from the praises which are proper to virtue itself. As
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxi" id="pagecxxi">[cxxi]</a></span>
of a most notorious thief, and wicked outlaw, which had lived all his
life-time of spoils and robberies, one of their bardes, in his praise,
will say, 'that he was none of the idle milk-sops that was brought
up by the fire-side, but that most of his days he spent in arms and
valiant enterprizes; that he never did eat his meat, before he had
won it with his sword; that he lay not all night slugging in his cabin
under his mantle, but used commonly to keep others waking to defend
their lives, and did light his candle at the flames of their houses
to lead him in the darkness; that the day was his night, and the night
his day; that he loved not to be long wooing of wenches to yield to
him; but, where he came, he took by force the spoil of other men's
love, and left but lamentations to their lovers; that his music was
not the harp, nor lays of love, but the cries of people, and clashing
of armour; and, finally, that he died, not bewailed of many, but made
many wail when he died, that dearly bought his death.' Do not you
think, Eudoxus, that many of these praises might be applied to men of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxii" id="pagecxxii">[cxxii]</a></span>
best deserts? Yet, are they all yielded to a most notable traitor,
and amongst some of the Irish not smally accounted of.&quot;&mdash;<i>State of
Ireland</i>. The same concurrence of circumstances, so well pointed
out by Spenser, as dictating the topics of the Irish bards, tuned the
border harps to the praise of an outlawed Armstrong, or Murray.</p>

<p>For similar reasons, flowing from the state of society, the reader
must not expect to find, in the border ballads, refined sentiment,
and, far less, elegant expression; although the stile of such
compositions has, in modern hands, been found highly susceptible of
both. But passages might be pointed out, in which the rude minstrel
has melted in natural pathos, or risen into rude energy. Even
where these graces are totally wanting, the interest of the stories
themselves, and the curious picture of manners, which they frequently
present, authorise them to claim some respect from the public. But
it is not the editor's present intention to enter upon a history of
border poetry; a subject of great difficulty, and which the extent
of his information does not as yet permit him to engage in. He
will, therefore, now lay before the reader the plan of the present
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxiii" id="pagecxxiii">[cxxiii]</a></span>
publication; pointing out the authorities from which his materials are
derived and slightly noticing the nature of the different classes into
which he has arranged them.</p>

<p><b>The MINSTRELSY of the SCOTTISH BORDER contains Three Classes of Poems:</b></p>
I. HISTORICAL BALLADS.<br />
II. ROMANTIC.<br />
III. IMITATIONS OF THESE COMPOSITIONS BY MODERN AUTHORS.<br />
<br />
<p>The Historical Ballad relates events, which we either know actually
to have taken place, or which, at least, making due allowance for the
exaggerations of poetical tradition, we may readily conceive to have
had some foundation in history. For reasons already mentioned, such
ballads were early current upon the border. Barbour informs us, that
he thinks it unnecessary to rehearse the account of a victory, gained
in Eskdale over the English, because</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxiv" id="pagecxxiv">[cxxiv]</a></span>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The Bruce</i>, Book XVI.</span><br />

<p>Godscroft also, in his History of the House of Douglas, written in the
reign of James VI., alludes more than once to the ballads current upon
the border, in which the exploits of those heroes were celebrated.
Such is the passage, relating to the death of William Douglas, Lord of
Liddesdale, slain by the Earl of Douglas, his kinsman, his godson,
and his chief<a name="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>. Similar strains of lamentation were poured by the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxv" id="pagecxxv">[cxxv]</a></span>
border poets over the tomb of the Hero of Otterbourne; and over the
unfortunate youths, who were dragged to an ignominious death, from
the very table at which they partook of the hospitality of their
sovereign. The only stanza, preserved of this last ballad, is
uncommonly animated&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Edinburgh castle, towne and toure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God grant thou sink for sinne!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that even for the black dinoure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Erl Douglas gat therein.</span><br />

<p>Who will not regret, with the editor, that compositions of such
interest and antiquity should be now irrecoverable? But it is the
nature of popular poetry, as of popular applause, perpetually to shift
with the objects of the time; and it is the frail chance of recovering
some old manuscript, which can alone gratify our curiosity regarding
the earlier efforts of the border muse. Some of her later strains,
composed during the sixteenth century, have survived even to the
present day; but the recollection of them has, of late years, become
like that of &quot;a tale which was told.&quot; In the sixteenth century, these
northern tales appear to have been popular even in London; for the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxvi" id="pagecxxvi">[cxxvi]</a></span>
learned Mr. Ritson has obligingly pointed out to me the following
passages, respecting the noted ballad of <i>Dick o' the Cow</i> (p.
157); &quot;Dick o' the Cow, that mad demi-lance northern borderer, who
plaid his prizes with the lord Jockey so bravely.&quot;&mdash;Nashe's
<i>Have with you to Saffren-Walden, or Gabriell Harvey's Hunt is
up</i>.&mdash;1596, 4to. <i>Epistle Dedicatorie</i>, <i>sig.</i> A. 2. 6.
And in a list of books, printed for, and sold by, P. Brocksby (1688),
occurs &quot;Dick-a-the-Cow, containing north country songs<a name="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>.&quot; Could
this collection have been found, it would probably have thrown much
light on the present publication: but the editor has been obliged to
draw his materials chiefly from oral tradition.</p>

<p>Something may be still found in the border cottages resembling the
scene described by Pennycuik.</p>

<p>The causes of the preservation of these songs have either entirely
ceased, or are gradually decaying Whether they were originally the
composition of minstrels, professing the joint arts of poetry
and music; or whether they were the occasional effusions of some
self-taught bard; is a question into which I do not here mean to
enquire. But it is certain, that, till a very late period, the pipers,
of whom there was one attached to each border town of note, and whose
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxviii" id="pagecxxviii">[cxxviii]</a></span>
office was often hereditary, were the great depositaries of oral,
and particularly of poetical, tradition. About spring time, and after
harvest, it was the custom of these musicians to make a progress
through a particular district of the country. The music and the tale
repaid their lodging, and they were usually gratified with a donation
of seed corn<a name="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>. This order of minstrels is alluded to in the comic
song of <i>Maggy Lauder</i>, who thus addresses a piper&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Live ye upo' the border?&quot;</span><br />

<p>By means of these men, much traditional poetry was preserved,
which must otherwise have perished. Other itinerants, not professed
musicians, found their welcome to their night's quarters readily
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxix" id="pagecxxix">[cxxix]</a></span>
insured by their knowledge in legendary lore. John Graeme, of Sowport,
in Cumberland, commonly called <i>The Long Quaker</i><a name="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>, a person
of this latter description, was very lately alive; and several of the
songs, now published, have been taken down from his recitation.
The shepherds also, and aged persons, in the recesses of the border
mountains, frequently remember and repeat the warlike songs of their
fathers. This is more especially the case in what are called the South
Highlands, where, in many instances, the same families have occupied
the same possessions for centuries.</p>

<p>It is chiefly from this latter source that the editor has drawn his
materials, most of which were collected, many years ago, during his
early youth. But he has been enabled, in many instances, to supply
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxx" id="pagecxxx">[cxxx]</a></span>
and correct the deficiencies of his own copies, from a collection of
border songs, frequently referred to in the work, under the title of
<i>Glenriddell's MS</i>. This was compiled, from various sources, by
the late Mr. Riddell, of Glenriddel, a sedulous border antiquary, and,
since his death, has become the property of Mr. Jollie, bookseller
at Carlisle; to whose liberality the editor owes the use of it, while
preparing this work for the press. No liberties have been taken,
either with the recited or written copies of these ballads, farther
than that, where they disagreed, which is by no means unusual, the
editor, in justice to the author, has uniformly preserved what seemed
to him the best, or most poetical, reading of the passage. Such
discrepancies must very frequently occur, wherever poetry is preserved
by oral tradition; for the reciter, making it a uniform principle to
proceed at all hazards, is very often, when his memory fails him, apt
to substitute large portions from some other tale, altogether distinct
from that which he has commenced. Besides, the prejudices of clans
and of districts have occasioned variations in the mode of telling
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxxi" id="pagecxxxi">[cxxxi]</a></span>
the same story. Some arrangement was also occasionally necessary, to
recover the rhyme, which was often, by the ignorance of the reciters,
transposed, or thrown into the middle of the line. With these
freedoms, which were essentially necessary to remove obvious
corruptions, and fit the ballads for the press, the editor presents
them to the public, under the complete assurance, that they carry with
them the most indisputable marks of their authenticity.</p>

<p>The same observations apply to the Second Class, here termed ROMANTIC
BALLADS; intended to comprehend such legends as are current upon the
border, relating to fictitious and marvellous adventures Such were
the tales, with which the friends of Spenser strove to beguile his
indisposition:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Some told of ladies, and their paramours;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some of brave knights, and their renowned squires;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some of the fairies, and their strange attires,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some of giants, hard to be believed.&quot;</span><br />

<p>These, carrying with them a general, and not merely a local, interest,
are much more extensively known among the peasantry of Scotland than
the border-raid ballads, the fame of which is in general confined to
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxxii" id="pagecxxxii">[cxxxii]</a></span>
the mountains where they were originally composed. Hence, it has been
easy to collect these tales of romance, to a number much greater than
the editor has chosen to insert in this publication<a name="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>. With this
class are now intermingled some lyric pieces, and some ballads, which,
though narrating real events, have no direct reference to border
history or manners. To the politeness and liberality of Mr. Herd, of
Edinburgh, the editor of the first classical collection of Scottish
songs and ballads (Edinburgh, 1774, 2 vols.), the editor is indebted
for the use of his MSS., containing songs and ballads, published and
unpublished, to the number of ninety and upwards. To this collection
frequent references are made, in the course of the following pages.
Two books of ballads, in MS., have also been communicated to me, by my
learned and respected friend, Alexander Fraser Tytler, Esq<a name="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>. I take
the liberty of transcribing Mr. Tytler's memorandum respecting the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxxiii" id="pagecxxxiii">[cxxxiii]</a></span>
manner in which they came into his hands. &quot;My father<a name="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> got the
following songs from an old friend, Mr. Thomas Gordon, professor
of philosophy, King's College, Aberdeen. The following extract of a
letter of the professor to me, explains how he came by them:&mdash;&quot;An
aunt of my children, Mrs Farquhar, now dead, who was married to the
proprietor of a small estate, near the sources of the Dee, in Braemar,
a good old woman, who spent the best part of her life among flocks
and herds, resided in her latter days in the town of Aberdeen. She was
possest of a most tenacious memory, which retained all the songs she
had heard from nurses and country-women in that sequestered part of
the country. Being maternally fond of my children, when young, she had
them much about her, and delighted them with her songs, and tales of
chivalry. My youngest daughter, Mrs Brown, at Falkland, is blest with
a memory as good as her aunt, and has almost the whole of her songs
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxxiv" id="pagecxxxiv">[cxxxiv]</a></span>
by heart. In conversation I mentioned them to your father, at whose
request, my grandson, Mr Scott, wrote down a parcel of them, as his
aunt sung them. Being then but a mere novice in music, he added, in
the copy, such musical notes, as, he supposed, might give your father
some notion of the airs, or rather lilts, to which they were sung.&quot;</p>

<p>From this curious and valuable collection, the editor has procured
very material assistance. At the same time, it contains many beautiful
legendary poems, of which he could not avail himself, as they seemed
to be the exclusive property of the bards of Angus and Aberdeenshire.
But the copies of such, as were known on the borders, have furnished
him with various readings, and with supplementary stanzas, which he
has frequent opportunities to acknowledge. The MSS. are cited under
the name of Mrs. Brown of Falkland, the ingenious lady, to whose taste
and memory the world is indebted for the preservation of the tales
which they contain. The other authorities, which occur during
the work, are particularly referred to. Much information has been
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxxv" id="pagecxxxv">[cxxxv]</a></span>
communicated to the editor, from various quarters, since the work
was first published of which he has availed himself, to correct and
enlarge the present edition.</p>

<p>In publishing both classes of ancient ballads, the editor has excluded
those which are to be found in the common collections of this nature,
unless in one or two instances, where he conceived it possible to give
some novelty, by historical or critical illustration.</p>

<p>It would have been easy for the editor to have given these songs
an appearance of more indisputable antiquity, by adopting the rude
orthography of the period, to which he is inclined to refer them. But
this (unless when MSS. of antiquity can be referred to) seemed too
arbitrary an exertion of the privileges of a publisher, and must,
besides, have unnecessarily increased the difficulties of many
readers. On the other hand, the utmost care has been taken, never
to reject a word or phrase, used by a reciter, however uncouth or
antiquated. Such barbarisms, which stamp upon the tales their age and
their nation, should be respected by an editor, as the hardy emblem of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxxvi" id="pagecxxxvi">[cxxxvi]</a></span>
his country was venerated by the Poet of Scotland:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rough bur-thistle spreading wide</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amang the bearded bear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I turn'd the weeder-clips aside,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spared the symbol dear.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">BURNS.</span><br />

<p>The meaning of such obsolete words is usually given at the bottom
of the page. For explanation of the more common peculiarities of the
Scottish dialect, the English reader is referred to the excellent
glossary annexed to the last edition of Burns' works.</p>

<p>The Third Class of Ballads are announced to the public, as MODERN
IMITATIONS of the Ancient Style of composition, in that department of
poetry; and they are founded upon such traditions as we may suppose in
the elder times would have employed the harps of the minstrels. This
kind of poetry has been supposed capable of uniting the vigorous
numbers and wild fiction, which occasionally charm us in the ancient
ballad, with a greater equality of versification, and elegance of
sentiment, than we can expect to find in the works of a rude age. But,
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxxvii" id="pagecxxxvii">[cxxxvii]</a></span>
upon my ideas of the nature and difficulty of such imitations, I ought
in prudence to be silent; lest I resemble the dwarf, who brought with
him a standard to measure his own stature. I may, however, hint at the
difference, not always attended to, betwixt legendary poems and real
imitations of the old ballad; the reader will find specimens of both
in the modern part of this collection. The legendary poem, called
<i>Glenfinlas</i>, and the ballad, entituled the <i>Eve of St.
John</i>, were designed as examples of the difference betwixt these
two kinds of composition.</p>

<p>It would have the appearance of personal vanity, were the editor to
detail the assistance and encouragement which he has received, during
his undertaking, from some of the first literary characters of our
age. The names of Stuart, Mackenzie, Ellis, Currie, and Ritson, with
many others, are talismans too powerful to be used, for bespeaking the
world's favour to a collection of old songs; even although a veteran
bard has remarked, &quot;that both the great poet of Italian rhyme,
Petrarch, and our Chaucer, and other of the upper house of the muses,
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxxxviii" id="pagecxxxviii">[cxxxviii]</a></span>
have thought their canzons honoured in the title of a ballad.&quot; To my
ingenious friend, Dr. John Leyden, my readers will at once perceive
that I lie under extensive obligations, for the poetical pieces, with
which he has permitted me to decorate my compilation; but I am yet
farther indebted to him for his uniform assistance, in collecting and
arranging materials for the work.</p>

<p>In the notes, and occasional dissertations, it has been my object
to throw together, perhaps without sufficient attention to method,
a variety of remarks, regarding popular superstitions, and legendary
history, which, if not now collected, must soon have been totally
forgotten. By such efforts, feeble as they are, I may contribute
somewhat to the history of my native country; the peculiar features
of whose manners and character are daily melting and dissolving into
those of her sister and ally. And, trivial as may appear such an
offering, to the manes of a kingdom, once proud and independent, I
hang it upon her altar with a mixture of feelings, which I shall not
attempt to describe.</p>

<p>&quot;Pleisith it your grace to be advertised, that upon Fridaye, at x a

their places assigned, the bushopricke men, my Lorde of Westmoreland,
and my Lord Dacre, in likewise evry man home with their companys,
without los of any men, thanked be God; saving viii or x slayne, and
dyvers hurt, at skyrmyshis and saults of the town of Gedwurth, and the
forteressis, which towne is soo suerly brent, that no garnysons ner
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxli" id="pagecxli">[cxli]</a></span>
none other shal bee lodged there, unto the tyme it bee newe buylded;
the brennyng whereof I comytted to twoo sure men, Sir William
Bulmer, and Thomas Tempeste. The towne was moche bettir then I went
(<i>i.e.</i> ween'd) it had been, for there was twoo tymys moo houses
therein then in Berwike, and well buylded, with many honest and faire
houses therein, sufficiente to have lodged M horsemen in garnyson, and
six good towres therein; whiche towne and towres be clenely distroyed,
brent, and throwen downe. Undoubtedly there was noo journey made into
Scotland, in noo manys day leving, with soo fewe a nombre that is
recownted to be soo high an enterprice as this, bothe with thies
contremen, and Scottishmen, nor of truthe so moche hurt doon. But in
th' ende a great mysfortune ded fall, onely by foly, that such ordre,
as was commaunded by me to be kepte, was not observed, the maner
whereof hereaftir shall ensue. Bifore myn entre into Scotland, I
appointed Sir William Bulmer and Sir William Evers too be marshallis
of th' army; Sir William Bulmer for the vangard, and Sir William Evers
for the reregard. In the vangard I appointed my Lord of Westmoreland,
as chief, with all the bushopricke, Sir William Bulmer, Sir William
Evers, my Lord Dacre, with all his company; and with me remayned
all the rest of the garnysons, and the Northumberland men. I was of
counsaill with the marshallis at th' ordering of our lodgingg, and our
campe was soo well envirowned with ordynance, carts, and dikes, that
hard it was to entre or issue, but at certain places appointed for
<span class="newpage"><a name="pageclxii" id="pagecxlii">[cxlii]</a></span>
that purpos, and assigned the mooste commodious place of the saide
campe for my Lord Dacre company, next the water, and next my Lord of
Westmoreland. And at suche tyme as my Lord Dacre came into the fald,
I being at the sault of th' abby, whiche contynued unto twoo houres
within nyght, my seid Lord Dacre wold in nowise bee contente to ly
within the campe, whiche was made right sure, but lodged himself
without, wherewith, at my retourne, I was not contente, but then it
was to late to remove; the next daye I sente my seid Lorde Dacre to a
strong hold, called Fernherst, the lorde whereof was his mortal enemy;
and with hym, Sir Arthur Darcy, Sir Marmaduke Constable, with viii c.
of their men, one cortoute, and dyvers other good peces of ordynance
for the feld (the seid Fernherste stode marvelous strongly, within a
grete woode); the seid twoo knights with the moost parte of their men,
and Strickland, your grace servaunte, with my Kendall men, went into
the woode on fote, with th' ordynance, where the said Kendall men were
soo handled, that they found hardy men, that went noo foote back for
theym; the other two knightes were alsoo soo sharply assayled, that
they were enforced to call for moo of their men; and yet could not
bring the ordynance to the forteresse, unto the tyme my Lord Dacre,
with part of his horsemen, lighted on fote; and marvelously hardly
handled himself, and fynally, with long skirmyshing, and moche
difficultie, gat forthe th' ordynance within the howse and threwe
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxliii" id="pagecxliii">[cxliii]</a></span>
downe the same. At which skyrmyshe, my seid Lord Dacre, and his
brother, Sir Cristofer, Sir Arthure, and Sir Marmaduke, and many other
gentilmen, did marvellously hardly; and found the best resistence
that hath been seen with my comyng to their parties, and above xxxii
Scottis sleyne, and not passing iiij Englishmen, but above lx hurt.
Aftir that, my seid lord retournyng to the campe, wold in nowise bee
lodged in the same, but where he laye the furst nyght. And he being
with me at souper, about viij a clok, the horses of his company brak
lowse, and sodenly ran out of his feld, in such nombre, that it caused
a marvellous alarome in our feld; and our standing watche being set,
the horses cam ronnyng along the campe, at whome were shot above one
hundred shief of arrowes, and dyvers gonnys, thinking they had been
Scotts, that wold have saulted the campe; fynally the horses were soo
madde, that they ran like wild dere into the feld; above xv c. at the
leest, in dyvers companys, and, in one place, above I felle downe
a gret rok, and slewe theymself, and above ij c. ran into the towne
being on fire, and by the women taken, and carried awaye right evill
brent, and many were taken agayne. But, fynally, by that I can esteme
by the nombre of theym that I sawe goo on foote the next daye, I think
thare is lost above viij c. horses, and all with foly for lak of
not lying within the camp. I dare not write the wondres that my Lord
Dacre, and all his company, doo saye they sawe that nyght, vj. tymys
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxliv" id="pagecxliv">[cxliv]</a></span>
of spirits and fereful sights. And unyversally all their company
saye playnly, the devill was that nyght among theym vi tymys; whiche
mysfortune hath blemyshed the best journey that was made in Scotland
many yeres. I assure your grace I found the Scottes, at this tyme, the
boldest men, and the hotest, that ever I sawe any nation, and all
the journey, upon all parts of th' army, kepte us with soo contynuall
skyrmyshe, that I never sawe the like. If they myght assemble xl M as
good men as I nowe sawe, xv c or ij M, it wold bee a hard encountre to
mete theym. Pitie it is of my Lord Dacres losse of the horses of his
company; he brought with hym above iiij M. men, and came and lodged
one night in Scotland, in his moost mortal enemy's centre. There is
noo herdyer, ner bettir knyght, but often tyme he doth not use the
most sure order, which he hath nowe payed derely for. Written at

<h4>HISTORY OF GEORDIE BOURNE.</h4>
<br />

<p>In the following passages, extracted from the memoirs of Sir Robert
Carey, then deputy of his father, Lord Hunsdon, warden of the east
marches, afterwards Earl of Monmouth, the reader will find a lively
illustration of the sketch given of border manners in the preceding
Introduction.</p>

<p>&quot;Having thus ended with my brother, I then beganne to thinke of the
charge I had taken upon mee, which was the government of the east
march, in my father's absence. I wrote to Sir Robert Kerr<a name="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>, who was
my opposite warden, a brave active young man, and desired him that hee
would appoint a day, when hee and myselfe might privately meet in
some part of the border, to take some good order for the quieting the
borders, till my retourne from London, which journey I was shortly of
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxlvi" id="pagecxlvi">[cxlvi]</a></span>
necessity to take. Hee stayed my man all night, and wrote to mee back,
that hee was glad to have the happinesse to be acquainted with mee,
and did not doubt but the country would be better governed by our good
agreements. I wrote to him on the Monday, and the Thursday after hee
appointed the place and hour of meeting.</p>

<p>&quot;After hee had filled my man with drinke, and putt him to bed, hee,
and some halfe a score with him, gott to horse, and came into England
to a little village. There hee broke up a house, and tooke out a poore
fellow, who (hee pretended) had done him some wrong, and before the
doore cruelly murthered him, and so came quietly home, and went to
bed. The next morning hee delivered my man a letter in answer to mine,
and retourned him to mee. It pleased mee well at the reading of his
kinde letter; but when I heard what a <i>brave</i> hee had put upon
mee, I quickly resolved what to do, which was, never to have to do
with him, till I was righted for the greate wrong hee had done mee.
Upon this resolution, the day I should have mett with him I tooke
post, and with all the haste I could, rode to London, leaving him to
attend my coming to him as was appointed. There hee stayed from
one till five, but heard no news of mee. Finding by this that I had
neglected him, hee retourned home to his house, and so things rested
(with greate dislike the one of the other) till I came back, which was
with all the speede I could, my businesse being ended. The first thing
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxlvii" id="pagecxlvii">[cxlvii]</a></span>
I did after my retourne, was to ask justice for the wrong hee had done
mee; but I could gett none. The borderers, seeing our disagreement,
they thought the time wished for of them was come. The winter being
beganne, their was roades made out of Scotland into the east march,
and goods were taken three or foure times a weeke. I had no other
meanes left to quiet them, but still sent out of the garrison horsemen
of Berwick, to watch in the fittest places for them, and it was their
good hap many times to light upon them, with the stolen goods driving
before them. They were no sooner brought before mee, but a jury went
upon them, and, being found guilty, they were frequently hanged:
a course which hath been seldom used, but I had no way to keep the
country quiet but to do so; for, when the Scotch theeves found what a
sharp course I tooke with them, that were found with the bloody hand,
I had in a short time the country more quiet. All this while wee were
but in jest as it were, but now beganne the greate quarrell betweene
us.</p>

<p>&quot;There was a favorite of his, a greate theife, called Geordie Bourne.
This gallant, with some of his associates would, in a bravery,
come and take goods in the east march. I had that night some of the
garrison abroad. They met with this Geordie and his fellowes, driving
of cattle before them. The garrison set upon them, and with a shott
killed Geordie Bourne's unckle, and hee himselfe bravely resisting
till he was sore hurt in the head, was taken. After hee was taken, his
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxlviii" id="pagecxlviii">[cxlviii]</a></span>
pride was such, as hee asked, who it was that durst avow that nightes
worke? but when hee heard it was the garrison, he was then more
quiet. But so powerfull and awfull was this Sir Robert Kerr, and his
favourites, as there was not a gentleman in all the east march that
durst offend them. Presently after hee was taken, I had most of the
gentlemen of the march come to mee, and told mee, that now I had the
ball at my foote, and might bring Sir Robert Kerr to what conditions I
pleased; for that this man's life was so neere and deare unto him, as
I should have all that my heart could desire, for the good and quiet
of the country and myselfe, if upon any condition I would give him his
life. I heard them and their reasons; notwithstanding, I called a jury
the next morning, and hee was found guilty of MARCH TREASON. Then they
feared that I would cause him to be executed that afternoone, which
made them come flocking to mee, humbly entreating mee, that I would
spare his life till the next day, and if Sir Robert Kerr came not
himselfe to mee, and made mee not such proffers, as I could not but
accept, that then I should do with him what I pleased. And further,
they told mee plainly, that if I should execute him, before I had
heard from Sir Robert Kerr, they must be forced to quitt their houses
and fly the country; for his fury would be such, against mee and the
march I commanded, as hee would use all his power and strength to the
utter destruction of the east march. They were so earnest with mee,
that I gave them my word hee should not dye that day. There was
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecxlix" id="pagecxlix">[cxlix]</a></span>
post upon post sent to Sir Robert Kerr, and some of them rode to him
themselves, to advertise him in what danger Geordie Bourne was; how he
was condemned, and should have been executed that afternoone, but, by
their humble suite, I gave them my word, that he should not dye that
day; and therefore besought him, that hee would send to mee, with all
the speede hee could, to let mee know, that hee would be the next day
with mee to offer mee good conditions for the safety of his life. When
all things were quiet, and the watch set at night, after supper, about
ten of the clock, I tooke one of my men's liveryes, and putt it about
mee, and tooke two other of my servants with mee in their liveryes,
and we three, as the warden's men, came to the provost marshall's,
where Bourne was, and were lett into his chamber. Wee sate down by
him, and told him, that wee were desirous to see him, because wee
heard hee was stoute and valiant, and true to his friend; and that
wee were sorry our master could not be moved to save his life. He
voluntarily of himselfe said, that hee had lived long enough to do
so many villainies as hee had done; and withal told us, that hee had
layne with about forty men's wives, what in England, what in Scotland;
and that hee had killed seven Englishmen with his own hands, cruelly
murthering them: that hee had spent his whole time in whoreing,
drinking, stealing, and taking deep revenge for slight offences.
Hee seemed to be very penitent, and much desired a minister for the
comfort of his soule. Wee promised him to lett our master know his
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecl" id="pagecl">[cl]</a></span>
desire, who, wee knew, would presently grant it. Wee tooke our leaves
of him, and presently I tooke order, that Mr. Selby, a very worthy
honest preacher, should go to him, and not stirre from him till his
execution the next morning; for, after I had heard his own confession,
I was resolved no conditions should save his life: and so tooke order,
that at the gates opening the next morning, hee should be carried to
execution, which accordingly was performed. The next morning I had one
from Sir Robert Kerr for a parley, who was within two miles staying
for mee. I sent him word, &quot;I would meet him where hee pleased, but I
would first know upon what termes and conditions.&quot; Before his man was
retourned, hee had heard, that in the morning, very early, Geordie
Bourne had been executed. Many vowes hee made of cruell revenge,
and retourned home full of griefe and disdaine, and, from that time
forward still plotted revenge. Hee knew the gentlemen of the country
were altogether sacklesse, and to make open road upon the march would
but shew his malice, and lay him open to the punishment due to such
offences. But his practice was how to be revenged on mee, or some of
mine.</p>

<p>&quot;It was not long after that my brother and I had intelligence, that
there was a great match made at footeball and the chiefe ryders were
to be there. The place they were to meet at was Kelsy, and that day,
wee heard it, was the day for the meeting. Wee presently called a
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecli" id="pagecli">[cli]</a></span>
counsaile, and after much dispute it was concluded, that the likeliest
place hee was to come to, was to kill the scoutes. And it was the more
suspected, for that my brother, before my coming to the office, for
the cattaile stolne out of the bounds, and as it were from under the
walles of Barwicke, being refused justice (upon his complaint,) or at
least delaid, sent off the garrison into Liddisdale, and killed there
the chiefe offender, which had done the wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Upon this conclusion, there was order taken, that both horse and
foote should lye in ambush, in diverse parts of the boundes, to defend
the scoutes, and to give a sound blow to Sir Robert and his company.
Before the horse and foote were sett out with directions what to
do, it was almost darke night, and the gates ready to be lockt. Wee
parted, and as I was by myselfe comeing to my house, God put it into
my mind, that it might well be, hee meant destruction to my men,
that I had sent out to gather tithes for mee at Norham, and their
rendezvous was every night to lye and sup at an ale-house in Norham.
I presently caused my page to take horse, and to ride as fast as his
horse could carry him, and to command my servants (which were in all
eight) that, presently upon his coming to them, they should all change
their lodging, and go streight to the castle, there to lye that night
in strawe and hay. Some of them were unwilling thereto, but durst
not disobey; so altogether left their ale-house, and retired to the
castle. They had not well settled themeselves to sleep, but they
<span class="newpage"><a name="pageclii" id="pageclii">[clii]</a></span>
heard in the town a great alarm; for Sir Robert and his company came
streight to the ale-house, broke open the doors, and made enquiry for
my servants. They were answered, that by my command they were all in
the castle. After they had searched all the house, and found none,
they feared they were betrayed, and, with all the speede they could,
made haste homewards again. Thus God blessed me from this bloody
tragedy.</p>

<p>&quot;All the whole march expected nightly some hurt to be done; but God so
blessed mee and the government I held, as, for all his fury, hee never
drew drop of blood in all my march, neither durst his theeves trouble
it much with stealing, for fear of hanging, if they were taken. Thus
wee continued a yeare, and then God sent a meanes to bring thinges to
better quiet by this occasion.</p>

<p>&quot;There had been commissioners in Barwicke, chosen by the queene and
king of Scottes, for the better quieting of our borders. By their
industry they found a great number of malefactors guilty, both in
England and Scotland; and they tooke order, that the officers of
Scotland should deliver such offenders, as were found guilty in their
jurisdictions, to the opposite officers in England, to be detained
prisoners, till they had made satisfaction for the goods they had
taken out of England. The like order was taken with the wardens of
England, and days prefixed for the delivery of them all. And in case
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecliii" id="pagecliii">[cliii]</a></span>
any of the officers, on either side, should omit their duties, in not
delivering the prisoners at the dayes and places appointed, that then
there should a course be taken by the soveraignes, that what chiefe
officer soever should offend herein, he himself should be delivered
and detained, till he had made good what the commissioners had agreed
upon.</p>

<p>&quot;The English officers did punctually, at the day and place, deliver
their prisoners, and so did most of the officers of Scotland; only
the Lord of Bocleuch and Sir Robert Kerr were faultie. They were
complained of, and new dayes appointed for the delivery of their
prisoners. Bocleuch was the first, that should deliver; and hee
failing entered himselfe prisoner into Barwicke, there to remaine till
those officers under his charge were delivered to free him. He
chose for his guardian Sir William Selby, master of the ordinance at
Barwicke. When Sir Robert Kerr's day of delivery came, he failed too,
and my Lord Hume, by the king's command, was to deliver him prisoner
into Barwicke upon the like termes, which was performed. Sir Robert
Kerr (contrary to all men's expectation) chose mee for his guardian,
and home I brought him to my own house, after hee was delivered to
mee. I lodged him as well as I could, and tooke order for his diet,
and men to attend on him, and sent him word, that (although by his
harsh carriage towards mee, ever since I had that charge, he could
not expect any favour, yet) hearing so much goodness of him, that hee
<span class="newpage"><a name="pagecliv" id="pagecliv">[cxliv]</a></span>
never broke his word, if hee should give mee his hand and credit to be
a true prisoner, hee would have no guard sett upon him, but have free
liberty for his friends in Scotland to have ingresse and regresse to
him as oft as hee pleased. He tooke this very kindly at my handes,
accepted of my offer, and sent me thankes.</p>

<p>&quot;Some four dayes passed; all which time his friends came into him, and
hee kept his chamber. Then hee sent to mee, and desired mee, I would
come and speake with him, which I did; and after long discourse,
charging and re-charging one another with wrong and injuries, at
last, before our parting, wee became good friends, with greate
protestations, on his side, never to give mee occasion of unkindnesse
again. After our reconciliation hee kept his chamber no longer, but
dined and supt with mee. I tooke him abroad with mee at the least
thrice a weeke, a hunting, and every day wee grew better friends.
Bocleuch, in a few dayes after, had his pledges delivered, and was
set at liberty. But Sir Robert Kerr could not get his, so that I was
commanded to carry him to Yorke, and there to deliver him prisoner to
the archbishop, which accordingly I did. At our parting, he professed
greate love unto mee for the kinde usage I had shewn him, and that I
would find the effects of it upon his delivery, which hee hoped would
be shortly.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus wee parted; and, not long after, his pledges were gott, and
brought to Yorke, and hee sett at liberty. After his retourne home,
I found him as good as his word. Wee met oft at dayes of truce, and I
<span class="newpage"><a name="pageclv" id="pageclv">[clv]</a></span>
had as good justice as I could desire; and so wee continued very kinde
and good friends, all the time that I stayed in that march, which was
not long.&quot;</p>

<h4>BOND OF ALLIANCE,
OR

BETWIXT THE CLANS OF SCOTT AND KER.</h4>
<br />

feud betwixt the name of Scott and Ker. The following indenture was
designed to reconcile their quarrel. But the alliance, if it ever took
effect, was not of long duration; for the feud again broke out about
1553, when Sir Walter Scott was slain by the Kers, in the streets of
Edinburgh.</p>

<h4>ANE INTERLUDE
OF THE LAYING OF A GAIST.</h4>
<br />

<p>This burlesque poem is preserved in the Bannatyne MSS. It is in the
same strain with the verses concerning the <i>Gyre Carline</i> (Vol.
II.) As the mention of <i>Bettokis Bowr</i> occurs in both pieces,
and as the scene of both is laid in East Lothian, they are perhaps
composed by the same author. The humour of these fragments seems to
have been directed against the superstitions of Rome; but it is
now become very obscure. Nevertheless, the verses are worthy of
preservation, for the sake of the ancient language and allusions.</p>

<h4>SUPPLEMENTAL STANZAS
TO COLLINS'S ODE
ON
THE SUPERSTITIONS OF THE HIGHLANDS.</h4>

<h4>BY</h4>

<h4>WILLIAM ERSKINE, ESQ.
ADVOCATE.</h4>
<br />

<p>The editor embraces this opportunity of presenting the reader with
the following stanzas, intended to commemorate some striking Scottish
superstitions, omitted by Collins in his ode upon that subject; and
which, if the editor can judge with impartiality of the production
of a valued friend, will be found worthy of the sublime original.
The reader must observe, that these verses form a continuation of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="pageclxx" id="pageclxx">[clxx]</a></span>
address, by Collins, to the author of <i>Douglas</i>, exhorting him to
celebrate the traditions of Scotland. They were first published in the
<i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>, for April, 1788.</p>

<a name="SIR_PATRICK_SPENS"></a><h2>SIR PATRICK SPENS.</h2>
<br />

<p>One edition of the present ballad is well known; having appeared in
the <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>, and having been inserted in
almost every subsequent collection of Scottish songs. But it seems
to have occurred to no editor, that a more complete copy of the song
might be procured. That, with which the public is now presented, is
taken from two MS. copies,<a name="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> collated with several verses recited by
the editor's friend, Robert Hamilton, Esq. advocate, being the 16th,
and the four which follow. But, even with the assistance of the
common copy, the ballad seems still to be a fragment. The cause of
Sir Patrick Spens' voyage is, however, pointed out distinctly; and it
shews, that the song has claim to high antiquity, as referring to a
very remote period in Scottish history.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page4" id="page4">[4]</a></span>
<p>Alexander III. of Scotland died in 1285; and, for the misfortune
of his country, as well as his own, he had been bereaved of all his
children before his decease. The crown of Scotland descended upon his
grand-daughter, Margaret, termed, by our historians, the <i>Maid of
Norway</i>. She was the only offspring of a marriage betwixt Eric,
king of Norway, and Margaret, daughter of Alexander III. The kingdom
had been secured to her by the parliament of Scotland, held at Scone,
the year preceding her grandfather's death. The regency of Scotland
entered into a congress with the ministers of the king of Norway and
with those of England, for the establishment of good order in
the kingdom of the infant princess. Shortly afterwards, Edward I.
conceived the idea of matching his eldest son, Edward, Prince of
Wales, with the young queen of Scotland. The plan was eagerly embraced
by the Scottish nobles; for, at that time, there was little of the
national animosity, which afterwards blazed betwixt the countries,
and they patriotically looked forward to the important advantage, of
uniting the island of Britain into one kingdom. But Eric of Norway
seems to have been unwilling to deliver up his daughter; and, while
the negociations were thus protracted, the death of the Maid of Norway
effectually crushed a scheme, the consequences of which might have
been, that the distinction betwixt England and Scotland would, in our
day, have been as obscure and uninteresting as that of the realms of
the heptarchy.&mdash;<i>Hailes' Annals. Fordun, &amp;c.</i></p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page5" id="page5">[5]</a></span>
<p>The unfortunate voyage of Sir Patrick Spens may really have taken
place, for the purpose of bringing back the Maid of Norway to her own
kingdom; a purpose, which was probably defeated by the jealousy of the
Norwegians, and the reluctance of King Eric. I find no traces of
the disaster in Scottish history; but, when we consider the meagre
materials, whence Scottish history is drawn, this is no conclusive
argument against the truth of the tradition. That a Scottish vessel,
sent upon such an embassy, must, as represented in the ballad, have
been freighted with the noblest youth in the kingdom, is sufficiently
probable; and, having been delayed in Norway, till the tempestuous
season was come on, its fate can be no matter of surprise. The
ambassadors, finally sent by the Scottish nation to receive their
queen, were Sir David Wemyss, of Wemyss, and Sir Michael Scot of
Balwearie; the same, whose knowledge, surpassing that of his age,
procured him the reputation of a wizard. But, perhaps, the expedition
of Sir Patrick Spens was previous to their embassy. The introduction
of the king into the ballad seems a deviation from history; unless
we suppose, that Alexander was, before his death, desirous to see his
grand-child and heir.</p>

<p>The Scottish monarchs were much addicted to &quot;sit in Dumfermline town,&quot;
previous to the accession of the Bruce dynasty. It was a favourite
abode of Alexander himself, who was killed by a fall from his horse,
in the vicinity, and was buried in the abbey of Dumfermline.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page6" id="page6">[6]</a></span>
<p>There is a beautiful German translation of this ballad, as it appeared
in the <i>Reliques</i>, in the Volk-Lieder of Professor Herder; an
elegant work, in which it is only to be regretted, that the actual
popular songs of the Germans form so trifling a proportion.</p>

<p>The tune of Mr. Hamilton's copy of <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i> is
different from that, to which the words are commonly sung; being less
plaintive, and having a bold nautical turn in the close.</p>

<h3>NOTES

SIR PATRICK SPENS.</h3>


<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>To send us out at this time of the year</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>To sail upon the sea</i>?&mdash;P. 8, v. 3.</span><br />

<p>By a Scottish act of parliament, it was enacted, that no ship should
be fraughted out of the kingdom, with any staple goods, betwixt
the feast of St. Simon's day and Jude and Candelmas.&mdash;<i>James III.
Parliament 2d, chap.</i> 15. Such was the terror entertained for
navigating the north seas in winter.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>When a bout flew out of our goodly ship</i>.&mdash;P. 10. v. 5.</span><br />

<p>I believe a modern seaman would say, a plank had started, which must
have been a frequent incident during the infancy of ship-building. The
remedy applied seems to be that mentioned in <i>Cook's Voyages</i>,
when, upon some occasion, to stop a leak, which could not be got at in
the inside, a quilted sail was brought under the vessel, which, being
drawn into the leak by the suction, prevented the entry of more water.
Chaucer says,</p>

<p>&quot;There n'is no new guise that it na'as old.&quot;</p>

<p>This concluding verse differs in the three copies of the ballad, which
I have collated. The printed edition bears,</p>

<p>And one of the MSS. reads,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;At the back of auld St. Johnstowne Dykes.&quot;</span><br />

<p>But, in a voyage from Norway, a shipwreck on the north coast seems
as probable as either in the Firth of Forth, or Tay; and the ballad
states the disaster to have taken place out of sight of land.</p>

<h4>NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</h4>
<br />

<p>This ballad, notwithstanding its present appearance, has a claim
to very high antiquity. It has been preserved by tradition; and is,
perhaps, the most authentic instance of a long and very old poem,
exclusively thus preserved. It is only known to a few old people, upon
the sequestered banks of the Ettrick; and is published, as written
down from the recitation of the mother of Mr. James Hogg<a name="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>, who
sings, or rather chaunts it, with great animation. She learned the
ballad from a blind man, who died at the advanced age of ninety,
and is said to have been possessed of much traditionary knowledge.
Although the language of this poem is much modernised, yet many words,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page16" id="page16">[16]</a></span>
which the reciters have retained, without understanding them, still
preserve traces of its antiquity. Such are the words <i>Springals</i>
(corruptly pronounced <i>Springwalls</i>), <i>sowies</i>,
<i>portcullize</i>, and many other appropriate terms of war and
chivalry, which could never have been introduced by a modern
ballad-maker. The incidents are striking and well-managed; and they
are in strict conformity with the manners of the age, in which they
are placed. The editor has, therefore, been induced to illustrate
them, at considerable length, by parallel passages from Froissard, and
other historians of the period to which the events refer.</p>

<p>The date of the ballad cannot be ascertained with any degree of
accuracy. Sir Richard Maitland, the hero of the poem, seems to have
been in possession of his estate about 1250; so that, as he survived
the commencement of the wars betwixt England and Scotland, in 1296,
his prowess against the English, in defence of his castle of Lauder,
or Thirlestane, must have been exerted during his extreme old age. He
seems to have been distinguished for devotion, as well as valour; for,
A.D. 1249, Dominus Ricardus de Mautlant gave to the abbey of Dryburgh,
&quot;<i>Terras suas de Haubentside, in territorio suo de Thirlestane,
pro salute animae suae, et sponsae suae, antecessorum suorum et
successorum suorum, in perpetuum</i><a name="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>.&quot; He also gave, to the same
<span class="newpage"><a name="page17" id="page17">[17]</a></span>
convent, &quot;<i>Omnes terras, quas Walterus de Giling tenuit in feodo suo
de Thirlestane, et pastura incommuni de Thirlestane, ad quadraginta
oves, sexaginta vaccas, et ad viginti equos</i>.&quot;&mdash;Cartulary of
Dryburgh Abbey, in the Advocates' Library.</p>

<p>From the following ballad, and from the family traditions referred to
in the Maitland MSS., Auld Maitland appears to have had three sons;
but we learn, from the latter authority, that only one survived him,
who was thence surnamed <i>Burd alane</i>, which signifies either
<i>unequalled</i>, or <i>solitary</i>. A <i>Consolation</i>, addressed
to Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington, a poet and scholar who
flourished about the middle of the sixteenth century, and who gives
name to the Maitland MSS., draws the following parallel betwixt his
domestic misfortunes and those of the first Sir Richard, his great
ancestor:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>An Consolator Ballad to the Richt Honorabill Sir Richert Maitland of Lethingtoune.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Maitland MSS. in Library of Edinburgh University.</span><br />

<p>Sir William Mautlant, or Maitland, the eldest and sole surviving son
of Sir Richard, ratified and confirmed, to the monks of Dryburgh,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page19" id="page19">[19]</a></span>
&quot;<i>Omnes terras quas Dominus Ricardus de Mautlant pater suus fecit
dictis monachis</i> <i>in territorio suo de Thirlestane,&quot; Sir William
is supposed to have died about 1315.&mdash;Crawford's Peerage</i>.</p>

<p>Such were the heroes of the ballad. The castle of Thirlestane is
situated upon the Leader, near the town of Lauder. Whether the present
building, which was erected by Chancellor Maitland, and improved by
the Duke of Lauderdale, occupies the site of the ancient castle, I
do not know; but it still merits the epithet of a &quot;<i>darksome
house</i>.&quot; I find no notice of the siege in history; but there is
nothing improbable in supposing, that the castle, during the stormy
period of the Baliol wars, may have held out against the English. The
creation of a nephew of Edward I., for the pleasure of slaying him by
the hand of young Maitland, is a poetical licence<a name="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>; and may induce
us to place the date of the composition about the reign of David II.,
or of his successor, when the real exploits of Maitland, and his sons,
were in some degree obscured, as well as magnified, by the lapse of
time. The inveterate hatred against the English, founded upon the
usurpation of Edward I., glows in every line of the ballad.</p>

<p>Auld Maitland is placed, by Gawain Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld,
among the popular heroes of romance, in his allegorical Palice of
Honour<a name="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>:</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page20" id="page20">[20]</a></span>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They suld be goddis in Ireland, as they say.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Robine Hude, and Gilbert with the quhite hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How Hay of Nauchton flew in Madin land.</span><br />

<p>In this curious verse, the most noted romances, or popular histories,
of the poet's day, seem to be noticed. The preceding stanza describes
the sports of the field; and that, which follows, refers to the tricks
of &quot;jugailrie;&quot; so that the three verses comprehend the whole pastimes
of the middle ages, which are aptly represented as the furniture of
dame Venus's chamber. The verse, referring to Maitland, is obviously
corrupted; the true reading was, probably, &quot;<i>with his</i> auld beird
<span class="newpage"><a name="page21" id="page21">[21]</a></span>
gray.&quot; Indeed the whole verse is full of errors and corruptions; which
is the greater pity, as it conveys information, to be found no where
else.</p>

<p>The descendant of Auld Maitland, Sir Richard of Lethington, seems to
have been frequently complimented on the popular renown of his great
ancestor. We have already seen one instance; and in an elegant copy
of verses in the Maitland MSS., in praise of Sir Richard's seat of
Lethingtoun, which he had built, or greatly improved, this obvious
topic of flattery does not escape the poet. From the terms of his
panegyric we learn, that the exploits of auld Sir Richard with the
gray beard, and of his three sons, were &quot;sung in many far countrie,
albeit in rural rhyme;&quot; from which we may infer, that they were
narrated rather in the shape of a popular ballad, than in a <i>romance
of price</i>. If this be the case, the song, now published, may have
undergone little variation since the date of the Maitland MSS.; for,
divesting the poem, in praise of Lethington, of its antique spelling,
it would run as smoothly, and appear as modern, as any verse in the
following ballad. The lines alluded to, are addressed to the castle of
Lethington:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And happie art thou sic a place,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That few thy mak ar sene:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But yit mair happie far that race</span><br />

<p>It is a curious circumstance, that this interesting tale, so often
referred to by ancient authors, should be now recovered in so perfect
a state; and many readers may be pleased to see the following sensible
observations, made by a person, born in Ettrick Forest, in the humble
situation of a shepherd. &quot;I am surprised to hear, that this song is
suspected by some to be a modern forgery; the contrary will be best
proved, by most of the old people, hereabouts, having a great part
of it by heart. Many, indeed, are not aware of the manners of this
country; till this present age, the poor illiterate people, in these
glens, knew of no other entertainment, in the long winter nights, than
repeating, and listening to, the feats of their ancestors, recorded in
songs, which I believe to be handed down, from father to son, for many
<span class="newpage"><a name="page23" id="page23">[23]</a></span>
generations; although, no doubt, had a copy been taken, at the end of
every fifty years, there must have been some difference, occasioned
by the gradual change of language. I believe it is thus that many
very ancient songs have been gradually modernised, to the common
ear; while, to the connoisseur, they present marks of their genuine
antiquity.&quot;&mdash;<i>Letter to the Editor from Mr. James Hogg</i>. To the
observations of my ingenious correspondent I have nothing to add,
but that, in this, and a thousand other instances, they accurately
coincide with my personal knowledge.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>A ready welcome found</i>.&mdash;P. 26. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>These two lines are modern, and inserted to complete the verse.
Dunbar, the fortress of Patrick, Earl of March, was too often opened
<span class="newpage"><a name="page39" id="page39">[39]</a></span>
to the English, by the treachery of that baron, during the reign of
Edward I.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>They laid their sowies to the wall</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Wi' many a heavy peal</i>.&mdash;P. 27. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>In this and the following verse, the attack and defence of a
fortress, during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, is described
accurately and concisely. The sow was a military engine, resembling
the Roman <i>testudo</i>. It was framed of wood, covered with hides,
and mounted on wheels, so that, being rolled forwards to the foot
of the besieged wall, it served as a shed, or cover, to defend the
miners, or those who wrought the battering ram, from the stones and
arrows of the garrison. In the course of the famous defence, made by
Black Agnes, Countess of March, of her husband's castle of Dunbar,
Montague, Earl of Salisbury, who commanded the besiegers, caused one
of these engines to be wheeled up to the wall. The countess, who, with
her damsels, kept her station on the battlements, and affected to wipe
off with her handkerchief the dust raised by the stones, hurled from
the English machines, awaited the approach of this new engine of
assault. &quot;Beware, Montague,&quot; she exclaimed, while the fragment of a
rock was discharged from the wall&mdash;&quot;Beware, Montague! for farrow shall
thy sow!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> Their cover being dashed to pieces, the assailants, with
great loss and difficulty, scrambled back to their trenches. &quot;By
the regard of suche a ladye,&quot; would Froissart have said, &quot;and by her
comforting, a man ought to be worth two men, at need.&quot; The sow was
called by the French <i>Truie</i>.&mdash;See <i>Hailes' Annals</i>,
Vol. II. p. 89. <i>Wintown's Cronykil</i>, Book VIII. <i>William of
Malmesbury</i>, Lib. IV.</p>

<p>The memory of the <i>sow</i> is preserved in Scotland by two
trifling circumstances. The name given to an oblong hay-stack, is a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page40" id="page40">[40]</a></span>
<i>hay-sow</i>; and this may give us a good idea of the form of the
machine. Children also play at a game with cherry stones, placing a
small heap on the ground, which they term a <i>sowie</i>, endeavouring
to hit it, by throwing single cherry-stones, as the sow was formerly
battered from the walls of the besieged fortress. My companions,
at the High School of Edinburgh, will remember what was meant by
<i>berrying a sowie</i>. It is strange to find traces of military
antiquities in the occupation of the husbandman, and the sports of
children.</p>

<p>The pitch and tar-barrels of Maitland were intended to consume the
formidable machines of the English. Thus, at a fabulous siege of York,
by Sir William Wallace, the same mode of defence is adopted:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Englishmen, that cruel were and kene,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Keeped their town, and fended there full fast;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faggots of fire among the host they cast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up <i>pitch and tar</i> on feil <i>sowis</i> they lent;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Many were hurt ere they from the walls went;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Stones on Springalds they did cast out so fast,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And goads of iron made many grome agast</i>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Henry the Minstrel's History of Wallace.&mdash;B. 8. c. 5.</span><br />

<p>A more authentic illustration may be derived from Barbour's Account
of the Siege of Berwick, by Edward II., in 1319, when a <i>sow</i>
was brought on to the attack by the English, and burned by the
combustibles hurled down upon it, through the device of John Crab, a
Flemish engineer, in the Scottish service.</p>

<p>The <i>springalds</i>, used in defence of the castle of Lauder,
were <i>balistae</i>, or large cross-bows, wrought by machinery, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page43" id="page43">[43]</a></span>
capable of throwing stones, beams, and huge darts. They were numbered
among the heavy artillery of the age; &quot;Than the kynge made all

garnished with bombardes, crosbowes, archers, <i>springalls</i>, and

<p>Goads, or sharpened bars of iron, were an obvious and formidable
missile weapon. Thus, at the assault of Rochemiglion &quot;They within
cast out great barres of iron, and pots with lyme, wherewith they
hurt divers Englishmen, such as adventured themselves too
far.&quot;&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, Vol. I. cap. 108.</p>

<p>From what has been noticed, the attack and defence of Lauder castle
will be found strictly conformable to the manners of the age; a
circumstance of great importance, in judging of the antiquity of the
ballad. There is no mention of guns, though these became so common in
the latter part of the reign of Edward III., that, at the siege of St.
Maloes, &quot;the English had well a four hondred gonnes, who shot day and
night into the fortresse, and agaynst it.&quot;&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, Vol.
I. cap. 336. Barbour informs us, that guns, or &quot;crakis of wer,&quot; as he
calls them, and crests for helmets, were first seen by the Scottish,
in their skirmishes with Edward the Third's host, in Northumberland
A.D. 1327.</p>

<p>If this be a Flemish, or Scottish, corruption for Ville de Grace, in
Normandy, that town was never besieged by Edward I., whose wars in
France were confined to the province of Gascony. The rapid change of
scene, from Scotland to France, excites a suspicion, that some verses
may have been lost in this place. The retreat of the English
host, however, may remind us of a passage, in Wintown, when, after
mentioning that the Earl of Salisbury raised the siege of Dunbar, to
join King Edward in France, he observes,</p>

<p>The romantic custom of atchieving, or attempting, some desperate and
perilous adventure, without either necessity or cause, was a peculiar,
and perhaps the most prominent, feature of chivalry. It was not merely
the duty, but the pride and delight, of a true knight, to perform such
exploits, as no one but a madman would have undertaken. I think it
is in the old French romance of <i>Erec and Eneide</i>, that an
adventure, the access to which lay through an avenue of stakes,
garnished with the bloody heads of the knights who had attempted and
failed to atchieve it, is called by the inviting title of <i>La joie
de la Cour</i>. To be first in advancing, or last in retreating; to
strike upon the gate of a certain fortress of the enemy; to fight
blindfold, or with one arm tied up; to carry off a banner, or to
defend one; were often the subjects of a particular vow, among the
sons of chivalry. Until some distinguishing exploit of this nature, a
young knight was not said to have <i>won his spurs</i>; and, upon some
occasions, he was obliged to bear, as a mark of thraldom, a chain upon
his arm, which was removed, with great ceremony, when his merit became
conspicuous. These chains are noticed in the romance of <i>Jehan de
Saintr&eacute;</i>. In the language of German chivalry, they were called
<i>Ketten des Gelubdes</i> (fetters of duty). Lord Herbert of Cherbury
informs us, that the knights of the Bath were obliged to wear certain
strings, of silk and gold, upon their left arm, until they had
atchieved some noble deed of arms. When Edward III. commenced his
<span class="newpage"><a name="page45" id="page45">[45]</a></span>
French wars, many of the young bachelors of England bound up one of
their eyes with a silk ribband, and swore, before the peacock and
the ladies, that they would not see with both eyes until they had
accomplished certain deeds of arms in France.&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, cap.
28.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of this chivalrous frenzy occurred during
the expedition of Sir Robert Knowles, who, in 1370, marched through
France, and laid waste the country, up to the very gates of Paris.
&quot;There was a knighte, in their companye, had made a vowe, the day
before, that he wolde ryde to the walles or gates of Parys, and stryke
at the barryers with his speare. And, for the fournyshing of his vowe,
he departed fro his companye, his spear in his fyst, his shelde
about his neck, armed at all pecesse, on a good horsse, his squyer on
another, behinde him, with his bassenet. And whan he approached neare
to Parys, he toke and dyde on his helme, and left his squyer behind
hym, and dashed his spurres to his horsse, and came gallopynge to
the barryers, the whiche as then were opyn; and the lordes, that were
there, had wened he wolde have entred into the towne; but that was
not his mynde; for, when he hadde stryken at the barryers, as he
had before avowed, he towrned his reyne, and drue back agayne, and
departed. Than the knightes of France, that sawe hym depart, sayd to
hym, 'Go your waye; you have ryghte well acquitted yourself.' I can
nat tell you what was thys knyghtes name, nor of what contre; but the
blazure of his armes was, goules, two fusses sable, a border sable.
Howbeit, in the subbarbes, he had a sore encontre; for, as he passed
on the pavement, he founde before hym a bocher, a bigge man, who had
well sene this knighte pass by. And he helde in his handes a sharpe
hevy axe, with a longe poynt; and, as the knyght returned agayne, and
toke no hede, this bocher came on his side, and gave the knyghte suche
a stroke, betwene the neck and the shulders, that he reversed forwarde
heedlynge, to the neck of his horsse, and yet he recovered agayne. And
than the bocher strake hym agayne, so that the axe entered into his
<span class="newpage"><a name="page46" id="page46">[46]</a></span>
body, so that, for payne, the knyghte fell to the erthe, and his
horsse ran away, and came to the squyer, who abode for his mayster
at the stretes ende. And so, the squyer toke the horsse, and had gret
marveyle what was become of his mayster; for he had well sene him
ryde to the barryers, and stryke therat with his glayve, and retourne
agayne. Thanne he rode a lytell forthe, thyderwarde, and anone he sawe
where his master layn upon the erthe, bytwene foure men, layenge on
him strokes, as they wolde have stryken on a stethey <i>(anvil)</i>;
and than the squyer was so affreyed, that he durst go no farther; for
he sawe well he could nat helpe his mayster. Therefore he retourned
as fast as he myght: so there the sayd knyghte was slayne. And the
knyghtes, that were at the gate, caused hym to be buried in holy
ground.&quot;&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, ch. 281.</p>

<p>A similar instance of a military jeopardy occurs in the same author,
ch. 364. It happened before the gates of Troyes. &quot;There was an
Englyshe squyre, borne in the bishopryke of Lincolne, an expert man
of armes; I can nat say whyder he could se or nat; but he spurred his
horse, his speare in his hande, and his targe about his necke; his
horse came rushyng downe the waye, and lept clene over the barres of
the baryers, and so galoped to the gate, where as the duke of Burgoyne
and the other lords of France were, who reputed that dede for a great
enterprise. The squyer thoughte to have returned, but he could nat;
for his horse was stryken with speares, and beaten downe, and
the squyer slayn; wherewith the Duke of Burgoyne was right sore
displeased.&quot;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Wilt thou lend me our king's standard,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>To bear a little way</i>?&mdash;P. 29. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>In all ages, and in almost all countries, the military standards have
been objects of respect to the soldiery, whose duty it is to range
beneath them, and, if necessary, to die in their defence. In the ages
of chivalry, these ensigns were distinguished by their shape, and by
the various names of banners, pennons, penoncelles, &amp;c., according to
the number of men, who were to fight under them. They were displayed,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page47" id="page47">[47]</a></span>
on the day of battle, with singular solemnity, and consigned to the
charge only of such as were thought willing and able to defend them to
the uttermost. When the army of Edward, the Black Prince, was drawn
up against that of Henry the Bastard, king of Castile, &quot;Than Sir Johan
Chandos brought his baner, rolled up togyder, to the prince, and said,
'Sir, behold, here is my baner. I requyre you display it abrode, and
give me leave, this daye, to raise it; for, sir, I thanke God and you,
I have land and heritage suffyciente to maynteyne it withal.' Than the
prince, and King Dampeter (Don Pedro), toke the baner betwene their
handes, and spred it abrode, the which was of sylver, a sharp pyle
gaules, and delyvered it to hym, and said, 'Sir Johan, behold here
youre baner; God sende you joye and honour thereof!' Than Sir Johan
Chandos bare his baner to his owne company, and sayde, 'Sirs, beholde
here my baner, and yours; kepe it as your owne.' And they toke it, and
were right joyful therof, and sayd, that, by the pleasure of God,
and Saint George, they wold kepe and defend it to the best of their
powers. And so the baner abode in the handes of a good Englishe
squyer, called William Alery, who bare it that day, and acquaytted
himself right nobly.&quot;&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, Vol. I. ch. 237. The loss of
a banner was not only great dishonour, but an infinite disadvantage.
At the battle of Cocherel, in Normandy, the flower of the combatants,
on each side, were engaged in the attack and defence of the banner of
the captall of Buche, the English leader. It was planted amid a
bush of thorns, and guarded by sixty men at arms, who defended it
gallantly. &quot;There were many rescues, and many a one hurt and cast to
the earth, and many feats of armes done, and many gret strokes given,
with good axes of steel, that it was wonder to behold.&quot; The battle did
not cease until the captall's standard was taken and torn to pieces.</p>

<p>We learn, from the following passage in <i>Stowe's Chronicle</i>, that
the standard of Edward I. was a golden dragon. &quot;The king entred Wales
with an army, appointing the footmen to occupie the enemies in fight,
whiles his horsemen, in a wing, set on the rere battell: himselfe,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page48" id="page48">[48]</a></span>
with a power, kept his place, where he pight his golden dragon, unto
whiche, as to a castle, the wounded and wearied might repair.&quot;</p>

<p>Stratagems, such as that of Maitland, were frequently practised with
success, in consequence of the complete armour worn by the knights of
the middle ages. In 1359, Edward III. entered France, to improve the
success of the battle of Poictiers. Two French knights, Sir Galahaut
of Rybamont, and Sir Roger of Cologne, rode forth, with their
followers, to survey the English host, and, in short, to seek
adventures. It chanced that they met a foraging party of Germans,
retained in King Edward's service, under the command of Reynold of
Boulant, a knight of that nation. By the counsel of a squire of his
retinue, Sir Galahaut joined company with the German knight, under the
assumed character of Bartholomew de Bonne, Reynold's countryman, and
fellow soldier in the English service. The French knights &quot;were a 70
men of armes, and Sir Renolde had not past a 30; and, whan Sir Renolde
saw theym, he displayed his baner befor hym, and came softely rydynge
towarde theym, wenyng to hym that they had been Englyshemen. Whan he
approched, he lyft up hys vyser, saluted Sir Galahaut, in the name of
Sir Bartylmewe de Bonnes. Sir Galahaut helde hymselfe styll secrete,
and answered but fayntly, and sayd, 'let us ryde forth;' and so rode
on, and hys men, on the one syde, and the Almaygnes on the other. Whan
Sir Renolde of Boulant sawe theyr maner, and howe Sir Galahaut rode
sometyme by hym, and spake no word, than he began to suspecte. And
he had not so ryden, the space of a quarter of an hour, but he stode
styll, under his baner, among hys men, and sayd, 'Sir, I have dout
what knyght ye be. I thynke ye be nat Sir Bartylmewe, for I knowe hym
well; and I see well that yt ys nat you. I woll ye telle me your name,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page49" id="page49">[49]</a></span>
or I ryde any farter in your company.' Therwith Sir Galahaut lyft
up hys vyser, and rode towardes the knyght to have taken hym by the
raygne of hys brydell, and cryed, '<i>Our Ladye of Rybamont</i>!' than
Sir Roger of Coloyne sayd, '<i>Coloyne to the rescue</i>!'<a name="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> Whan
Sir Renolde of Boulant sawe what case he was in, he was nat gretly
afrayed, but drewe out his sworde; and, as Sir Galahaut wolde have
taken hym by the brydell, Sir Renolde put his sworde clene through
hym, and drue agayne hys sworde out of hym, and toke his horse, with
the spurres, and left Sir Galahaut sore hurt. And, whan Sir Galahautes
men sawe theyr master in that case, they were sore dyspleased, and set
on Sir Renolde's men; there were many cast to the yerth, but as sone
as Sir Renolde had gyven Sir Galahaut that stroke, he strak hys horse
with the spurres, and toke the feldes. Than certayne of Galahaut's
squyers chasyd hym, and, whan he sawe that they folowed hym so nere,
that he muste other tourne agayne, or els be shamed, lyke a hardy
knyght he tourned, and abode the foremost, and gave hym such a stroke,
that he had no more lyste to folwe him. And thus, as he rode on, he
served three of theym, that folowed hym, and wounded theym sore: if a
goode axe had been in hys hand, at every stroke he had slayne a man.
He dyd so muche, that he was out of danger of the Frenchmen, and saved
hymselfe withoute any hurte; the whyche hys enemyes reputed for a
grete prowess, and so dyd all other that harde thereof; but hys men
were nere slayne or taken, but few that were saved. And Sir Galahaut
was caryed from thence sore hurt to Perone; of that hurt he was never
after perfectly hole; for he was a knyght of suche courage, that, for
all his hurte, he wold not spare hymselfe; wherefore he lyved not long
after.&quot;&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, Vol. I. Chap. 207.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir Walter Mauny, retreating into the fortress of Hanyboute,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page50" id="page50">[50]</a></span>
after a successful sally, was pursued by the besiegers, who ranne
after them, lyke madde men; than Sir Gualtier saide, &quot;Let me never
be beloved wyth my lady, without I have a course wyth one of these
folowers!&quot; and turning, with his lance in the rest, he overthrew
several of his pursuers, before he condescended to continue his
retreat.</p>

<p>&quot;The Lord of Hangest (pursued by the English) came so to the barryers
(of Vandonne) that were open, as his happe was, and so entred in

valiantly.&quot;&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, Vol. I. Chap. 367.</p>

<p>The sieges, during the middle ages, frequently afforded opportunity
for single combat, of which the scene was usually the draw-bridge,
or barriers, of the town. The former, as the more desperate place of
battle, was frequently chosen by knights, who chose to break a lance
for honour, and their ladies' love. In 1387, Sir William Douglas,
lord of Nithisdale, upon the draw-bridge of the town of Carlisle,
consisting of two beams, hardly two feet in breadth, encountered and
slew, first, a single champion of England, and afterwards two, who
attacked him together.&mdash;<i>Forduni Scotichronicon</i>, Lib. XIV. cap.

<span class="newpage"><a name="page51" id="page51">[51]</a></span>
<p>These combats at the barriers, or palisades, which formed the outer
fortification of a town, were so frequent, that the mode of attack and
defence was early taught to the future knight, and continued long
to be practised in the games of chivalry. The custom, therefore, of
defying the inhabitants of a besieged town to this sort of contest,
was highly fashionable in the middle ages; and an army could hardly
appear before a place, without giving rise to a variety of combats
at the barriers, which were, in general, conducted without any unfair
advantage being taken on either part.</p>

<p>The following striking example of this romantic custom occurs in
Froissart. During the French wars of Edward the Black Prince, and in
the year 1370, a body of English, and of adventurers retained in
his service, approached the city of Noyon, then occupied by a French
garrison, and arrayed themselves, with displayed banners, before
the town, defying the defenders to battle. &quot;There was a Scottysh
knyghte<a name="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> dyde there a goodly feate of armes, for he departed fro
his companye, hys speare in hys hand, and mounted on a good horse, hys
page behynde hyme, and so came before the barryers. Thys knyghte was
called Sir Johan Assueton,<a name="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> a hardy man and a couragyous. Whan he
was before the barryers of Noyon, he lyghted a-fote, and sayd to hys
page, 'Holde, kepe my horse, and departe nat hens;' and so wente to
the barryers. And wythyn the barryers, there were good knyghtes; as,
Sir John of Roy, Sir Lancelat of Loutys, and a x or xii other, who
had grete marveyle what thys sayde knyghte wolde do. Than he sayde to
them, 'Sirs, I am come hyder to se you. I se well, ye wyll nat issue
<span class="newpage"><a name="page52" id="page52">[52]</a></span>
out of your barryers; therefore I will entre, and I can, and wyll
prove my knyghthode agaynst yours; wyn me and ye can.' And therewyth
he layde on, round about hym, and they at hym. And thus, he alone
fought agaynst them, more than an houre; and dyd hurte two or three
of them; so that they of the towne, on the walles and garrettes,
stode still, and behelde them, and had great pleasure to regarde his
valyauntness, and dyd him no hurte; the whiche they myght have done,
if they hadde list to have shotte, or cast stones at hym. And also
the French knyghtes charged them to let hym and them alone togyder. So
long they foughte, that, at last, his page came near to the barryers,
and spake in his langage, and sayd, 'Sir, come awaye; it is time for
you to departe, for your cumpanye is departyng hens.' The knyghte
harde hym well, and than gave a two or three strokes about him, and
so, armed as he was, he lepte out of the barryers, and lepte upon
his horse, without any hurte, behynde his page; and sayd to the
Frenchemen, 'Adue, sirs! I thank you;' and so rode forthe to his
owne company. The whiche dede was moche praysed of many
folkes.&quot;&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, cap. 278.</p>

<p>The barriers, so often alluded to, are described, by the same
admirable historian, to be grated pallisades, the grates being
about half a foot wide. In a skirmish before Honycourt, Sir Henry
of Flanders ventured to thrust his sword so far through one of those
spaces, that a sturdy abbot, who was within, seized his sword-arm,
and drew it through the harriers, up to the shoulder. In this aukward
situation he remained for some time, being unwilling to dishonour
himself by quitting his weapon. He was at length rescued, but lost his
sword; which Froissart afterwards saw preserved, as a relique, in the
monastery of Honycourt.&mdash;Vol. I. chap. 39. For instances of single
combats, at the barriers, see the same author, <i>passim</i>.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And if the twa suld slay ye baith,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Ye'se get na help frae me</i>.&mdash;P. 34. v. 5.</span><br />

<p>According to the laws of chivalry, laws, which were also for a long
<span class="newpage"><a name="page53" id="page53">[53]</a></span>
time observed in duels, when two or more persons were engaged on
each side, he, who first conquered his immediate antagonist, was at
liberty, if he pleased, to come to the assistance of his companions.
The play of the &quot;<i>Little French Lawyer</i>&quot; turns entirely upon this
circumstance; and it may be remarked throughout the poems of Boiardo
and Ariosto; particularly in the combat of three Christian and three
Pagan champions, in the 42d canto of <i>Orlando Furioso</i>. But
doubtless a gallant knight was often unwilling, like young Maitland,
to avail himself of this advantage. Something of this kind seems to
have happened in the celebrated combat, fought in the presence of
James II. at Stirling, in 1449, between three French, or Flemish,
warriors, and three noble Scottishmen, two of whom were of the house
of Douglas. The reader will find a literal translation of Olivier
de la Marche's account of this celebrated tourney, in <i>Pinkerton's
History</i>, Vol. I. p. 428.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>I am nae king, nor nae sic thing:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>My word it shanna stand</i>!&mdash;P. 35. v. 2.</span><br />

<p>Maitland's apology for retracting his promise to stand neuter, is as
curious as his doing so is natural. The unfortunate John of France was
wont to say, that, if truth and faith were banished from all the rest
of the universe, they should still reside in the breast and the mouth
of kings.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>They maul'd him cruellie</i>.&mdash;P. 35. v. 5.</span><br />

<p>This has a vulgar sound, but is actually a phrase of romance. <i>Tant
frappent et</i> maillent <i>lex deux vassaux l'un sur l'autre, que
leurs heaumes, et leurs hauberts, sont tous cassez et rompus</i>.&mdash;La
fleur des Battailes.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>But, wi' the poll-axe in his hand,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Upon the brigg sprang he</i>.&mdash;P. 36. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>The battle-axe, of which there are many kinds, was a knightly weapon,
much used in the middle ages, as well in single combat as in battle.
&quot;And also there was a younge bachelor, called Bertrande of Glesguyne,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page54" id="page54">[54]</a></span>
who duryng the seige, fought wyth an Englyshman, called Sir Nycholas
Dagerne; and that batayle was takene thre courses wyth a speare,
thre strokes wyth an axe, and thre wyth a dagger. And eche of these
knyghtes bare themselves so valyantly, that they departed fro the
felde wythout any damage, and they were well regarded, bothe of theyme
wythyn, and they wythout.&quot; This happened at the siege of Rennes, by
the Duke of Lancaster, in 1357.&mdash;<i>Froissart</i>, Vol. I. c. 175.
With the same weapon Godfrey of Harcourt long defended himself, when
surprised and defeated by the French. &quot;And Sir Godfraye's men kepte
no goode array, nor dyd nat as they had promysed; moost part of theyme
fledde: whan Sir Godfraye sawe that, he sayde to hymselfe, howe he had
rather there be slayne than be taken by the Frenchmen; there he toke
hys axe in hys handes, and set fast the one legge before the other, to
stonde the more surely; for hys one legge was a lytell crooked, but
he was strong in the armes. Ther he fought valyantly and long: none
durste well abyde hys strokes; than two Frenchmen mounted on theyr
horses, and ranne both with their speares at ones at hym, and so
bare hym to the yerth: than other, that were a-fote, came wyth theyr
swerdes, and strake hym into the body, under his barneys, so that
ther he was slayne.&quot;&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>, chap. 172. The historian throws Sir
Godfrey into a striking attitude of desperation.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>When Maitland saw his ain blude fa',</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>An angry man was he</i>,&mdash;P. 37, v. 1.</span><br />

<p>There is a saying, that a Scottishman fights best after seeing his own
blood. Camerarius has contrived to hitch this foolish proverb into
a national compliment; for he quotes it as an instance of the
persevering gallantry of his countrymen. &quot;<i>Si in pugna proprium
effundi sanguinem vidissent, non statim prostrato animo concedebant,
sed irato potius in hostes velut furentes omnibus viribus
incurrebant</i>.&quot;</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page55" id="page55">[55]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>That Edward once lay under me,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And e'er gat up again</i>.&mdash;P. 37. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>Some reciters repeat it thus:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;That <i>Englishman</i> lay under me,&quot;</span><br />

<p>which is in the true spirit of Blind Harry, who makes Wallace say,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I like better to see the southeron die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Than gold or land, that they can gie to me.&quot;</span><br />

<p>In slaying Edward, Maitland acts pitilessly, but not contrary to
the laws of arms, which did not enjoin a knight to shew mercy to his
antagonist, until he yielded him, &quot;<i>rescue or no rescue</i>.&quot;
Thus, the seigneur de Languerant came before the walls of an English
garrison, in Gascony, and defied any of the defenders to run a course
with a spear: his challenge being accepted by Bertrand Courant, the
governor of the place, they couched their spears, like good knights,
and dashed on their horses. Their spears were broke to pieces, and
Languerant was overthrown, and lost his helmet among the horses' feet.
His attendants were coming up; but Bernard drew his dagger, and said,
&quot;Sir, yield ye my prisoner, rescue or no rescue; else ye are but
dead.&quot; The dismounted champion spoke not a word; on which, Bertrand,
entering into fervent ire, dashed his dagger into his skull. Besides,
the battle was not always finished by one warrior obtaining this
advantage over the other. In the battle of Nejara, the famous Sir John
Chandos was overthrown, and held down, by a gigantic Spanish cavalier,
named Martino Fernandez. &quot;Then Sir Johan Chandos remembred of a knyfe,
that he had in his bosome, and drew it out, and struck this Martyne
so in the backe, and in the sydes, that he wounded him to dethe, as he
laye upon hym.&quot; The dagger, which the knights employed in these close
and desperate struggles, was called the <i>poniard of mercy</i>.</p>

<a name="BATTLE_OF_OTTERBOURNE"></a><h2>BATTLE OF OTTERBOURNE.</h2>

<h4>THE SCOTTISH EDITION.</h4>
<br />

<p>The following edition of the Battle of Otterbourne, being essentially
different from that which is published in the <i>Reliques of Ancient
Poetry</i>, Vol. I. and being obviously of Scottish composition,
claims a place in the present collection. The particulars of that
noted action are related by Froissard, with the highest encomium upon
the valour of the combatants on each side. James, Earl of Douglas,
with his brother, the Earl of Murray, in 1387 invaded Northumberland,
at the head of 3000 men; while the Earls of Fife and Strathern, sons
to the king of Scotland, ravaged the western borders of England, with
a still more numerous army. Douglas penetrated as far as Newcastle,
where the renowned Hotspur lay in garrison. In a skirmish before the
walls, Percy's lance, with the pennon, or guidon, attached to it,
was taken by Douglas, as most authors affirm, in a personal encounter
<span class="newpage"><a name="page57" id="page57">[57]</a></span>
betwixt the two heroes. The earl shook the pennon aloft, and swore
he would carry it as his spoil into Scotland, and plant it upon
his castle of Dalkeith. &quot;That,&quot; answered Percy, &quot;shalt thou
never!&quot;&mdash;Accordingly, having collected the forces of the marches, to a
number equal, or (according to the Scottish historians) much superior,
to the army of Douglas, Hotspur made a night attack upon the Scottish
camp, at Otterbourne, about thirty-two miles from Newcastle. An
action took place, fought, by moon-light, with uncommon gallantry and
desperation. At length, Douglas, armed with an iron mace, which
few but he could wield, rushed into the thickest of the English
battalions, followed only by his chaplain, and two squires of his
body.<a name="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> Before his followers could come up, their brave leader was
stretched on the ground, with three mortal wounds: his squires lay
dead by his side; the priest alone, armed with a lance, was protecting
his master from farther injury. &quot;I die like my forefathers,&quot; said the
expiring hero, &quot;in a field of battle, and not on a bed of sickness.
Conceal my death, defend my standard,<a name="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> and avenge my fall! It is
<span class="newpage"><a name="page58" id="page58">[58]</a></span>
an old prophecy, that a dead man shall gain a field,<a name="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> and I hope
it will be accomplished this night.&quot;&mdash;<i>Godscroft</i>.&mdash;With these
words he expired; and the fight was renewed with double obstinacy
around his body. When morning appeared, however, victory began to
incline to the Scottish side. Ralph Percy, brother to Hotspur,
was made prisoner by the earl Marischal, and, shortly after, Harry
Percy<a name="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> himself was taken by Lord Montgomery. The number of
captives, according to Wyntoun, nearly equalled that of the victors.
Upon this the English retired, and left the Scots masters of
the dear-bought honours of the field. But the bishop of Durham
approaching, at the head of a body of fresh forces, not only checked
the pursuit of the victors, but made prisoners some of the stragglers,
who had urged the chase too far. The battle was not, however, renewed,
as the bishop of Durham did not venture to attempt the rescue of
Percy. The field was fought 15th August, 1388.&mdash;<i>Fordun, Froissard,
Hollinshed, Godscroft</i>.</p>

<p>The ground, on which this memorable engagement took place, is now the
property of John Davidson, Esq. of Newcastle, and still retains
the name of Battle Cross. A cross, erroneously termed <i>Percy's
Cross</i>, has been erected upon the spot where the gallant Earl
of Douglas is supposed to have fallen. These particulars were
<span class="newpage"><a name="page59" id="page59">[59]</a></span>
communicated to the editor, in the most obliging manner, by the
present proprietor of Otterbourne.</p>

<p>The ballad, published in the <i>Reliques</i>, is avowedly an English
production; and the author, with a natural partiality, leans to
the side of his countrymen; yet, that ballad, or some one similar,
modified probably by national prejudice, must have been current in
Scotland during the reign of James VI.: for Godscroft, in treating of
this battle, mentions its having been the subject of popular song, and
proceeds thus: But that, which is commonly sung of the <i>Hunting of
Chiviot</i>, seemeth indeed poetical, and a mere fiction, perhaps to
stir up virtue; yet a fiction whereof there is no mention, either in
the Scottish or English Chronicle. Neither are the songs, that are
made of them, both one; for the <i>Scots song made of Otterbourne</i>,
telleth the time, about Lammas; and also the occasion, to take preys
out of England; also the dividing the armies betwixt the earls of Fife
and Douglas, and their several journeys, almost as in the authentic
history. It beginneth thus;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;It fell about the Lammas tide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;When yeomen win their hay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The doughty Douglas 'gan to ride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;In England to take a prey.&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">GODSCROFT, <i>ed. Edin</i>. 1743. Vol. I. p. 195.</span><br />

<p>I cannot venture to assert, that the stanzas, here published, belong
<span class="newpage"><a name="page60" id="page60">[60]</a></span>
to the ballad alluded to by Godscroft; but they come much nearer to
his description than the copy published in the first edition, which
represented Douglas as falling by the poignard of a faithless
page. Yet we learn, from the same author, that the story of the
assassination was not without foundation in tradition.&mdash;&quot;There are
that say, that he (Douglas) was not slain by the enemy, but by one of
his own men, a groom of his chamber, whom he had struck the day before
with a truncheon, in ordering of the battle, because he saw him make
somewhat slowly to. And they name this man John Bickerton of Luffness,
who left a part of his armour behind, unfastened, and when he was in
the greatest conflict, this servant of his came behind his back, and
slew him thereat.&quot;&mdash;<i>Godscroft, ut supra</i>.&mdash;&quot;But this narration,&quot;
adds the historian, &quot;is not so probable.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> Indeed, it seems to
have no foundation, but the common desire of assigning some remote and
extraordinary cause for the death of a great man. The following ballad
is also inaccurate in many other particulars, and is much shorter, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page61" id="page61">[61]</a></span>
more indistinct, than that printed in the <i>Reliques</i>, although
many verses are almost the same. Hotspur, for instance, is called
<i>Earl Percy</i>, a title he never enjoyed; neither was Douglas
buried on the field of battle, but in Melrose Abbey, where his tomb is
still shown.</p>

<p>This song was first published from Mr. Herd's <i>Collection of
Scottish Songs and Ballads</i>, Edin. 1774: 2 vols. octavo; but two
recited copies have fortunately been obtained from the recitation of
old persons residing at the head of Ettrick Forest, by which the story
is brought out, and completed, in a manner much more correspondent to
the true history.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss the subject of the Battle of Otterbourne, without
stating (with all the deference due to the father of this species of
literature) a doubt, which occurs to me, as to the account given of
&quot;Sir John of Agurstone,&quot; one of the Scottish warriors, in the learned
and excellent notes subjoined to the ballad, in the <i>Reliques of
Ancient Poetry</i>. This personage is there supposed to have been
one of the Haggerstons of Haggerston, a Northumbrian family, who,
according to the fate of war, were sometimes subjects of Scotland. I
cannot, however, think, that at this period, while the English were
in possession both of Berwick and Roxburgh, with the intermediate
fortresses of Wark, Cornwall, and Norham, the Scots possessed any
part of Northumberland, much less a manor which lay within that strong
chain of castles. I should presume the person alluded to rather to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page62" id="page62">[62]</a></span>
have been one of the Rutherfords, barons of Edgerstane, or Adgerston,
a warlike family, which has long flourished on the Scottish borders,
and who were, at this very period, retainers of the house of Douglas.
The same notes contain an account of the other Scottish warriors of
distinction, who were present at the battle. These were, the earls
of Monteith, Buchan, and Huntley; the barons of Maxwell and Johnston;
Swinton of that ilk, an ancient family which, about that period,
produced several distinguished warriors; Sir David (or rather, as the
learned editor well remarks, Sir Walter) Scott of Buccleuch, Stewart
of Garlies, and Murray of Cockpool.</p>

<a name="NOTES_ON_THE_BATTLE_OF_OTTERBOURNE."></a><h3>NOTES ON THE BATTLE OF OTTERBOURNE.</h3>

<p><i>He chose the Gordons and the Graemes</i>.&mdash;P. 64. v. 2.</p>

<p>The illustrious family of Gordon was originally settled upon the lands
of Gordon and Huntly, in the shire of Berwick, and are, therefore, of
border extraction. The steps, by which they removed from thence to the
shires of Aberdeen and Inverness, are worthy notice. In 1300, Adam de
Gordon was warden of the marches.&mdash;<i>Rymer</i>, Vol. II. p. 870. He
obtained, from Robert the Bruce, a grant of the forfeited estate of
David de Strathbolgie, Earl of Athol; but no possession followed,
the earl having returned to his allegiance.&mdash;John de Gordon, his
great-grandson, obtained, from Robert II., a new charter of the lands
of Strathbolgie, which had been once more and finally forfeited, by
David, Earl of Athol, slaine in the battle of Kilblene. This grant is
dated 13th July, 1376. John de Gordon who was destined to transfer,
from the borders of England to those of the Highlands, a powerful
and martial race, was himself a redoubted warrior, and many of his
exploits occur in the annals of that turbulent period. In 1371-2, the
English borderers invaded and plundered the lands of Gordon, on the
Scottish east march. Sir John of Gordon retaliated, by an incursion
<span class="newpage"><a name="page72" id="page72">[72]</a></span>
on Northumberland, where he collected much spoil. But, as he returned
with his booty, he was attacked, at unawares, by Sir John Lillburne,
a Northumbrian, who, with a superior force, lay near Carham in ambush,
to intercept him. Gordon harangued and cheered his followers, charged
the English gallantly, and, after having himself been five times in
great peril, gained a complete victory; slaying many southerns, and
taking their leader and his brother captive. According to the prior of
Lochlevin, he was desperately wounded; but</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Thare rays a welle gret renowne,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And gretly prysyd wes gud Gordown.&quot;</span><br />

<p>Shortly after this exploit, Sir John of Gordon encountered and
routed Sir Thomas Musgrave, a renowned English marc-hman whom he made
prisoner. The lord of Johnstone had, about the same time, gained a
great advantage on the west border; and hence, says Wynton,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He and the Lord of Gordowne</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had a soverane gud renown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of ony that war of thare degr&eacute;,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For full thai war of gret bount&eacute;.</span><br />

<p>Upon another occasion, John of Gordon is said to have partially
succeeded in the surprisal of the town of Berwick, although the
superiority of the garrison obliged him to relinquish his enterprise.</p>

<p>The ballad is accurate, in introducing this warrior, with his clan,
into the host of Douglas at Otterbourne. Perhaps, as he was in
possession of his extensive northern domains, he brought to the
field the northern broad-swords, as well as the lances of his eastern
borderers. With his gallant leader, he lost his life in the deadly
conflict. The English ballad commemorates his valour and prudence;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The Erle of Huntley, cawte and kene.&quot;</span><br />

<p>But the title is a premature designation. The earldom of Huntly was
first conferred on Alexander Seaton, who married the grand-daughter
<span class="newpage"><a name="page73" id="page73">[73]</a></span>
of the hero of Otterbourne, and assumed his title from Huntly, in the
north. Besides his eldest son Adam, who carried on the line of the
family, Sir John de Gordon left two sons, known, in tradition, by
the familiar names of <i>Jock</i> and <i>Tam</i>. The former was the
ancestor of the Gordons of Pitlurg; the latter of those of Lesmoir,
and of Craig-Gordon. This last family is now represented by James
Gordon, Esq. of Craig, being the eleventh, in direct descent, from Sir
John de Gordon.</p>
<br />

<p><i>The Graemes</i>.</p>

<p>The clan of Graeme, always numerous and powerful upon the border, were
of Scottish origin, and deduce the descent of their chieftain, Graeme
of Netherby, from John <i>with the bright sword</i>, a son of Malice
Graeme, Earl of Menteith, who flourished in the fourteenth century.
Latterly, they <i>became Englishmen</i>, as the phrase went, and
settled upon the Debateable Land, whence they were transported to
Ireland, by James VI., with the exception of a very few respectable
families; &quot;because,&quot; said his majesty in a proclamation, &quot;they do all
(but especially the Graemes) confess themselves to be no meet persons
to live in these countries; and also, to the intent their lands may
be inhabited by others, of good and honest conversation.&quot; But, in the
reign of Henry IV., the Graemes of the border still adhered to the
Scottish allegiance, as appears from the tower of Graeme in Annandale,
Graemes Walls in Tweeddale, and other castles within Scotland, to
which they have given their name. The reader is, however, at liberty
to suppose, that the Graemes of the Lennox and Menteith, always ready
to shed their blood in the cause of their country, on this occasion
joined Douglas.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>With them the Lindsays light and gay</i>.&mdash;p. 64. v. 2.</span><br />

<p>The chief of this ancient family, at the date of the battle of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page74" id="page74">[74]</a></span>
Otterbourne, was David Liudissay, lord of Glenesk, afterwards created
Earl of Crawford. He was, after the manner of the times, a most
accomplished knight. He survived the battle of Otterbourne, and the
succeeding carnage of Homildon. In May, 1390, he went to England, to
seek adventures of chivalry; and justed, upon London Bridge, against
the lord of Wells, an English knight, with so much skill and success,
as to excite, among the spectators, a suspicion that he was tied
to his saddle; which he removed, by riding up to the royal chair,
vaulting out of his saddle, and resuming his seat without assistance,
although loaded with complete armour. In 1392, Lindsay was nearly
slain in a strange manner. A band of Catterans, or wild Highlanders,
had broken down from the Grampian Hills, and were engaged in
plundering the county of Angus. Walter Ogilvy, the sheriff, with
Sir Patrick Gray, marched against them, and were joined by Sir
David Lindsay. Their whole retinue did not exceed sixty men, and the
Highlanders were above three hundred. Nevertheless, trusting to
the superiority of arms and discipline, the knights rushed on the
invaders, at Gasclune, in the Stormont. The issue was unfortunate.
Ogilvy, his brother, and many of his kindred, were overpowered and
slain. Lindsay, armed at all points, made great slaughter among the
naked Catterans; but, as he pinned one of them to the earth with
his lance, the dying mountaineer writhed upwards and, collecting
his force, fetched a blow with his broad-sword which cut through the
knight's stirrup-leather and steel-boot and nearly severed his leg.
The Highlander expired, and Lindsay was with difficulty borne out of
the field by his followers&mdash;<i>Wyntown</i>. Lindsay is also noted
for a retort, made to the famous Hotspur. At a march-meeting, at
Haldane-Stank, he happened to observe, that Percy was sheathed in
complete armour. &quot;It is for fear of the English horsemen,&quot; said
Percy, in explanation; for he was already meditating the insurrection,
immortalised by Shakespeare. &quot;Ah! Sir Harry,&quot; answered Lindsay, &quot;I
have seen you more sorely bestad by Scottish footmen than by English
horse.&quot;&mdash;<i>Wyntown</i>. Such was the leader of the &quot;<i>Lindsays light
and guy</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Froissard, there were three Lindsays in the battle of
Otterbourne, whom he calls Sir William, Sir James, and Sir Alexander.
To Sir James Lindsay there fell &quot;a strange chance of war,&quot; which I
<span class="newpage"><a name="page75" id="page75">[75]</a></span>
give in the words of the old historian. &quot;I shall shewe you of Sir
Mathewe Reedman (an English warrior, and governor of Berwick), who
was on horsebacke, to save himselfe, for he alone coude nat remedy the
mater. At his departynge, Sir James Limsay was nere him, and sawe Sir
Mathewe departed. And this Sir James, to wyn honour, followed in chase
Sir Mathewe Reedman, and came so nere him, that he myght have stryken
hym with hys speare, if he had lyst. Than he said, 'Ah! Sir knyght,
tourne! it is a shame thus to fly! I am James of Lindsay. If ye
will nat tourne, I shall strike you on the back with my speare.' Sir
Mathewe spoke no worde, but struke his hors with his spurres sorer
than he did before. In this maner he chased hym more than three myles.
And at last Sir Mathewe Reedman's hors foundered, and fell under hym.
Than he stept forthe on the erthe, and drewe oute his swerde, and toke
corage to defend himselfe. And the Scotte thoughte to have stryken hym
on the brest, but Sir Mathewe Reedman swerved fro the stroke, and the
speare point entred into the erthe. Than Sir Mathewe strake asonder
the speare wyth his swerde. And whan Sir James Limsay sawe howe he had
lost his speare, he cast away the tronchon, and lyghted a-fote, and
toke a lytell battell-axe, that he carryed at his backe, and handled
it with his one hand, quickly and delyverly, in the whyche feate
Scottes be well experte. And than he set at Sir Mathewe, and he
defended himselfe properly. Thus they journeyed toguyder, one with an
axe, and the other with a swerde, a longe season, and no man to lette
them. Fynally, Sir James Limsay gave the knyght such strokes, and
helde him so shorte, that he was putte out of brethe in such wyse,
that he yelded himselfe, and sayde,&mdash;'Sir James Limsay, I yeld me to
you.'&mdash;'Well,' quod he; 'and I receyve you, rescue or no rescue.'&mdash;'I
am content,' quod Reedman, 'so ye dele wyth me like a good
companyon.'&mdash;'I shall not fayle that,' quod Limsay, and so put up his
swerde. 'Well,' said Reedman, 'what will ye nowe that I shall do? I
am your prisoner; ye have conquered me; I wolde gladly go agayn
<span class="newpage"><a name="page76" id="page76">[76]</a></span>
to Newcastell, and, within fiftene dayes, I shall come to you into
Scotlande, where as ye shall assigne me.'&mdash;'I am content,' quod
Limsay; 'ye shall promyse, by your faythe, to present yourselfe,
within these foure wekes, at Edinborowe; and wheresoever ye go,
to repute yourselfe my prisoner.' All this Sir Mathewe sware, and
promised to fulfil.&quot;</p>

<p>The warriors parted upon these liberal terms, and Reedman returned
to Newcastle. But Lindsay had scarcely ridden a mile, when he met the
bishop of Durham, with 500 horse, whom he rode towards, believing them
to be Scottish, until he was too near them to escape. The bysshoppe
stepte to him, and sayde, 'Limsay, ye are taken; yelde ye to
me.'&mdash;'Who be you?' quod Limsay. 'I am,' quod he, 'the bysshoppe of
Durham.'&mdash;'And fro whens come you, sir?' quod Limsay. 'I come fro the
battell,' quod the bysshoppe, 'but I strucke never a stroke there. I
go backe to Newcastell for this night, and ye shal go with me.'&mdash;'I
may not chuse,' quod Limsay, 'sith ye will have it so. I have taken,
and I am taken; suche is the adventures of armes.' Lindsay was
accordingly conveyed to the bishop's lodgings in Newcastle, and here
he was met by his prisoner, Sir Matthew Reedman; who founde hym in a
studye, lying in a windowe, and sayde, 'What! Sir James Lindsay, what
make you here?' Than Sir James came forth of the study to him, and
saydc, 'By my fayth, Sir Mathewe, fortune hath brought me hyder; for,
as soon as I was departed fro you, I mete by chaunce the bisshoppe of
Durham, to whom I am prisoner, as ye be to me. I beleve ye shall
not nede to come to Edenborowe to me to mak your fynaunce. I thynk,
rather, we shall make an exchange one for another, if the bysshoppe
be also contente.'&mdash;'Well, sir,' quod Reedman, 'we shall accord ryghte
well toguyder; ye shall dine this day with me: the bysshoppe and our
men be gone forth to fyght with your men. I can nat tell what we
shall know at their retourne.'&mdash;'I am content to dyne with you,' quod
Limsay.&quot;&mdash;<i>Froissart's Chronicle</i>, translated by Bourchier, Lord

<a name="THE_SANG"></a><h2>THE SANG OF THE OUTLAW MURRAY.</h2>
<br />

<p>This ballad appears to have been composed about the reign of James V.
It commemorates a transaction, supposed to have taken place betwixt a
Scottish monarch, and an ancestor of the ancient family of Murray of
Philiphaugh in Selkirkshire. The editor is unable to ascertain the
historical foundation of the tale; nor is it probable that any light
can be thrown upon the subject, without an accurate examination of
the family charter chest. It is certain, that, during the civil wars
betwixt Bruce and Baliol, the family of Philiphaugh existed, and was
powerful; for their ancestor, Archibald de Moravia, subscribes the
oath of fealty to Edward I.A.D. 1296. It is, therefore, not unlikely,
that, residing in a wild and frontier country, they may have, at one
<span class="newpage"><a name="page79" id="page79">[79]</a></span>
period or other, during these commotions, refused allegiance to the
feeble monarch of the day, and thus extorted from him some grant of
territory or jurisdiction. It is also certain, that, by a charter
from James IV., dated November 30, 1509, John Murray of Philiphaugh
is vested with the dignity of heritable sheriff of Ettrick Forest,
an office held by his descendants till the final abolition of such
jurisdictions by 28th George II. cap. 23. But it seems difficult to
believe that the circumstances, mentioned in the ballad, could occur
under the reign of so vigorous a monarch as James IV. It is true, that
the <i>Dramatis Personae</i> introduced seem to refer to the end of
the fifteenth, or beginning of the sixteenth, century; but from this
it can only be argued, that the author himself lived soon after that
period. It may, therefore, be supposed (unless farther evidence can
be produced, tending to invalidate the conclusion), that the bard,
willing to pay his court to the family, has connected the grant of the
sheriffship by James IV. with some further dispute betwixt the Murrays
of Philiphaugh and their sovereign, occurring, either while they were
engaged upon the side of Baliol, or in the subsequent reigns of David
II. and Robert II. and III., when the English possessed great part
of the Scottish frontier, and the rest was in so lawless a state as
hardly to acknowledge any superior. At the same time, this reasoning
is not absolutely conclusive. James IV. had particular reasons for
desiring that Ettrick Forest, which actually formed part of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page80" id="page80">[80]</a></span>
jointure lands of Margaret, his queen, should be kept in a state of
tranquillity.&mdash;<i>Rymer</i>, Vol. XIII. p. 66. In order to accomplish
this object, it was natural for him, according to the policy of his
predecessors to invest one great family with the power of keeping
order among the rest. It is even probable, that the Philiphaugh family
may have had claims upon part of the lordship of Ettrick Forest, which
lay intermingled with their own extensive possessions; and, in the
course of arranging, not indeed the feudal superiority, but the
property, of these lands, a dispute may have arisen, of sufficient
importance to be the ground-work of a ballad.&mdash;It is farther probable,
that the Murrays, like other border clans, were in a very lawless
state, and held their lands merely by occupancy, without any feudal
right. Indeed, the lands of the various proprietors in Ettrick Forest
(being a royal demesne) were held by the possessors, not in property,
but as the kindly tenants, or rentallers, of the crown; and it is only
about 150 years since they obtained charters, striking the feu-duty of
each proprietor, at the rate of the quit-rent, which he formerly paid.
This state of possession naturally led to a confusion of rights and
claims. The kings of Scotland were often reduced to the humiliating
necessity of compromising such matters with their rebellious subjects,
and James himself even entered into a sort of league with Johnie Faa,
the king of the gypsies.&mdash;Perhaps, therefore, the tradition, handed
<span class="newpage"><a name="page81" id="page81">[81]</a></span>
down in this song, may have had more foundation than it would at
present be proper positively to assert.</p>

<p>The merit of this beautiful old tale, it is thought, will be fully
acknowledged. It has been, for ages, a popular song in Selkirkshire.
The scene is, by the common people, supposed to have been the castle
of Newark, upon Yarrow. This is highly improbable, because Newark was
always a royal fortress. Indeed, the late excellent antiquarian Mr.
Plummer, sheriff-depute of Selkirkshire, has assured the editor,
that he remembered the <i>insignia</i> of the unicorns, &amp;c. so
often mentioned in the ballad, in existence upon the old tower at
Hangingshaw, the seat of the Philiphaugh family; although, upon first
perusing a copy of the ballad, he was inclined to subscribe to the
popular opinion. The tower of Hangingshaw has been demolished for many
years. It stood in a romantic and solitary situation, on the classical
banks of the Yarrow. When the mountains around Hangingshaw were
covered with the wild copse which constituted a Scottish forest, a
more secure strong-hold for an outlawed baron can hardly be imagined.</p>

<p>The tradition of Ettrick Forest bears, that the Outlaw was a man of
prodigious strength, possessing a batton or club, with which he laid
<i>lee</i> (i.e. waste) the country for many miles round; and that
he was at length slain by Buccleuch, or some of his clan, at a little
mount, covered with fir-trees, adjoining to Newark castle, and said to
have been a part of the garden. A varying tradition bears the place
<span class="newpage"><a name="page82" id="page82">[82]</a></span>
of his death to have been near to the house of the Duke of Buccleuch's
game-keeper, beneath the castle; and, that the fatal arrow was shot by
Scot of Haining, from the ruins of a cottage on the opposite side of
the Yarrow. There was extant, within these twenty years, some verses
of a song on his death. The feud betwixt the Outlaw and the Scotts may
serve to explain the asperity, with which the chieftain of that clan
is handled in the ballad.</p>

<p>In publishing the following ballad, the copy principally resorted to
is one, apparently of considerable antiquity, which was found among
the papers of the late Mrs. Cockburn, of Edinburgh, a lady whose
memory will be long honoured by all who knew her. Another copy, much
more imperfect, is to be found in Glenriddel's MSS. The names are in
this last miserably mangled, as is always the case when ballads are
taken down from the recitation of persons living at a distance from
the scenes in which they are laid. Mr. Plummer also gave the editor a
few additional verses, not contained in either copy, which are thrown
into what seemed their proper place. There is yet another copy, in Mr.
Herd's MSS., which has been occasionally made use of. Two verses are
restored in the present edition, from the recitation of Mr. Mungo
Park, whose toils, during his patient and intrepid travels in Africa,
have not eradicated from his recollection the legendary lore of his
native country.</p>

<p>The arms of the Philiphaugh family are said by tradition to allude
<span class="newpage"><a name="page83" id="page83">[83]</a></span>
to their outlawed state. They are indeed those of a huntsman, and are
blazoned thus; Argent, a hunting horn sable, stringed and garnished
gules, on a chief azure, three stars of the first. Crest, a Demi
Forester, winding his horn, proper. Motto, <i>Hinc usque superna
venabor</i>.</p>

<br />

<p><i>Then spak the Lord, hight Hamilton</i>.&mdash;P. 86. v. 4.</p>

<p>This is, in most copies, the <i>earl</i> hight Hamilton, which must be
a mistake of the reciters, as the family did not enjoy that title till
1503.</p>
<br />

<p><i>James Boyd (the Earl of Arran his brother), &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. 87. v. 2.</p>

<p>Thomas Boyd, Earl of Arran, was forfeited, with his father and uncle,
in 1469, for an attempt on the person of James III. He had a son,
James, who was restored, and in favour with James IV. about 1482. If
this be the person here meant, we should read &quot;The Earl of Arran his
<i>son</i> was he.&quot; Glenriddel's copy reads, &quot;A highland laird I'm
sure was he.&quot; Reciters sometimes call the messenger, the laird of
Skene.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Down Birkendale Brae when that he cam</i>.&mdash;P. 88, v. 2.</span><br />

<p>Birkendale Brae, now commonly called <i>Birkendailly</i>, is a steep
descent on the south side of Minch-Moor, which separates Tweeddale
from Ettrick Forest; and from the top of which you have the first view
of the woods of Hangingshaw, the castle of Newark, and the romantic
dale of Yarrow.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page101" id="page101">[101]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The laird of the Corehead, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. 93. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>This is a place at the head of Moffat-water, possessed of old by the
family of Halliday.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>To Andrew Murray of Cockpool</i>.&mdash;P. 94. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>This family were ancestors of the Murrays, earls of Annandale; but the
name of the representative, in the time of James IV. was William, not
Andrew. Glenriddel's MS. reads, &quot;the country-keeper.&quot;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>To Sir James Murray of Traquair</i>.&mdash;P. 94. v. 3.</span><br />

<p>Before the barony of Traquair became the property of the Stewarts, it
belonged to a family of Murrays, afterwards Murrays of Black-barony,
and ancestors of Lord Elibank. The old castle was situated on the
Tweed. The lands of Traquair were forfeited by Willielmus de Moravia,
previous to 1464; for, in that year, a charter, proceeding upon his
forfeiture, was granted by the crown &quot;Willielmo Douglas de Cluny.&quot; Sir
James was, perhaps, the heir of William Murray. It would farther seem,
that the grant in 1464 was not made effectual by Douglas; for, another
charter from the crown, dated the 3d February, 1478, conveys the
estate of Traquair to James Stewart, Earl of Buchan, son to the
black knight of Lorne, and maternal uncle to James III., from whom
is descended the present Earl of Traquair. The first royal grant not
being followed by possession, it is very possible that the Murrays may
have continued to occupy Traquair long after the date of that charter.
Hence, Sir James might have reason to say, as in the ballad, &quot;The king
has gifted my lands lang syne.&quot;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>James Hop Pringle of Torsonse</i>.&mdash;P. 97. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>The honourable name of Pringle, or Hoppringle, is of great antiquity
in Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire. The old tower of Torsonse is
situated upon the banks of the Gala. I believe the Pringles of
Torsonse are now represented by Sir James Pringle of Stitchell. There
are three other ancient and distinguished families of this name; those
<span class="newpage"><a name="page102" id="page102">[102]</a></span>
of Whitebank, Clifton, and Torwoodlee.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>He bids ye mete him at Permanscore</i>.&mdash;P. 98. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>Permanscore is a hollow on the top of a high ridge of hills,
dividing the vales of Tweed and Yarrow, a little to the east-ward of
Minch-Moor. It is the outermost point of the lands of Broadmeadows.
The Glenriddel MS., which, in this instance, is extremely inaccurate
as to names, calls the place of rendezvous &quot;<i>The Poor Man's
house</i>,&quot; and hints, that the Outlaw was surprised by the treachery
of the king:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>&quot;Then he was aware of the king's coming,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>With hundreds three in company,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>I wot the muckle deel * * * * *</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>He learned kings to lie!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>For to fetch me here frae amang my men,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Here like a dog for to die.&quot;</i></span><br />

<p>I believe the reader will think, with me, that the catastrophe is
better, as now printed from Mrs. Cockburn's copy. The deceit supposed
to be practised on the Outlaw, is unworthy of the military monarch,
as he is painted in the ballad; especially if we admit him to be King
James IV.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Fair Philiphaugh is mine by right</i>.&mdash;P. 101. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>In this and the following verse, the ceremony of feudal investiture is
supposed to be gone through, by the Outlaw resigning his possessions
into the hands of the king, and receiving them back, to be held of
him as superior. The lands of Philiphaugh are still possessed by the
Outlaw's representative. Hangingshaw and Lewinshope were sold of
late years. Newark, Foulshiels and Tinnies, have long belonged to the
family of Buccleuch.</p>

<a name="JOHNIE_ARMSTRANG"></a><h2>JOHNIE ARMSTRANG.</h2>
<br />

<p>There will be such frequent occasion, in the course of this volume, to
mention the clan, or sept, of the Armstrongs, that the editor finds
it necessary to prefix, to this ballad, some general account of that
tribe.</p>

<p>The Armstrongs appear to have been, at an early period, in possession
of great part of Liddesdale, and of the Debateable Land. Their
immediate neighbourhood to England, rendered them the most lawless of
the Border depredators; and, as much of the country possessed by them
was claimed by both kingdoms, the inhabitants, protected from justice
by the one nation, in opposition to the other, securely preyed upon
both.<a name="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> The chief was Armstrong of Mangertoun; but, at a later
<span class="newpage"><a name="page104" id="page104">[104]</a></span>
period, they are declared a broken clan, i.e. one which had no lawful
head, to become surety for their good behaviour. The rapacity of this
clan, and of their allies, the Elliots, occasioned the popular saying,
&quot;Elliots and Armstrongs ride thieves all.&quot;&mdash;But to what Border-family
of note, in former days, would not such an adage have been equally
applicable? All along the river Liddel may still be discovered the
ruins of towers, possessed by this numerous clan. They did not,
however, entirely trust to these fastnesses; but, when attacked by a
superior force, abandoned entirely their dwellings, and retired into
morasses, accessible by paths known to themselves alone. One of
their most noted places of refuge was the Tarras Moss, a desolate and
horrible marsh, through which a small river takes its course. Upon its
banks are found some dry spots, which were occupied by these outlaws,
and their families, in cases of emergency. The stream runs furiously
among huge rocks, which has occasioned a popular saying&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Was ne'er are drown'd in Tarras, nor yet in doubt,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>For e'er the head can win down, the harns (brains) are out.</i></span><br />

<p>The morass itself is so deep, that, according to an old historian, two
spears tied together would not reach the bottom. In this retreat,
the Armstrongs, <i>anno</i> 1588, baffled the Earl of Angus, when
lieutenant on the Border, although he reckoned himself so skilful in
winding a thief, that he declared, &quot;he had the same pleasure in it,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page105" id="page105">[105]</a></span>
as others in a hunting a hare.&quot; On this occasion he was totally
unsuccessful, and nearly lost his relation, Douglas of Ively, whom the
freebooters made prisoner.&mdash;<i>Godscroft</i> Vol. II. p. 411.</p>

<p>Upon another occasion the Armstrongs were less fortunate. They had,
in one of their incursions, plundered the town of Haltwhistle, on the
borders of Cumberland. Sir Robert Carey, warden of the west marches,
demanded satisfaction from the king of Scotland, and received for
answer, that the offenders were no subjects of his, and that he
might take his own revenge. The English warden, accordingly entered
Llddesdale, and ravaged the lands of the outlaws; on which occasion,
<i>Sim of the Cat-hill</i> (an Armstrong) was killed by one of the
Ridleys of Haltwhistle. This incident procured Haltwhistle another
visit from the Armstrongs, in which they burnt great part of the town,
but not without losing one of their leaders, by a shot from a window.</p>

<p>&quot;The death of this young man (says Sir Robert Carey) wrote (wrought)
so deep an impression upon them (the outlaws), as many vowes were
made, that, before the end of next winter, they would lay the whole
Border waste. This (the murder) was done about the end of May (1598).
The chiefe of all these outlaws was <i>old Sim of Whittram</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>
He had five or six sonnes, as able men as the Borders had. This old
<span class="newpage"><a name="page106" id="page106">[106]</a></span>
man and his sonnes had not so few as two hundred at their commands,
that were ever ready to ride with them to all actions, at their beck.</p>

<p>The high parts of the marsh (march) towards Scotland were put in a
mighty fear, and the chiefe of them, for themselves and the rest,
petitioned to mee, and did assure mee, that, unless I did take some
course with them, by the end of that summer, there was none of the
inhabitants durst, or would, stay in their dwellings the next winter,
but they would fley the countrey, and leave their houses and lands to
the fury of the outlawes. Upon this complaint, I called the gentlemen
of the countrey together, and acquainted them with the misery that the
highest parts of the marsh towards Scotland were likely to endure, if
there were not timely prevention to avoid it, and desired them to
give mee their best advice what course were fitt to be taken. They all
showed themselves willing to give mee their best counsailles, and most
of them were of opinion, that I was not well advised to refuse the
hundred horse that my Lord Euers had; and that now my best way was
speedily to acquaint the quene and counsaile with the necessity of
having more soldiers, and that there could not be less than a hundred
horse sent downe for the defence of the countrey, besides the forty I
had already in pay, and that there was nothing but force of soldiers
could keep them in awe: and to let the counsaile plainly understand,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page107" id="page107">[107]</a></span>
that the marsh, of themselves, were not able to subsist, whenever the
winter and long nights came in, unlesse present cure and remedy were
provided for them. I desired them to advise better of it, and to see
if they could find out any other meanes to prevent their mischievous
intentions, without putting the quene and countrey to any further
charge. They all resolved that there was no second meanes. Then I told
them my intention what I meant to do, which was, that myselfe, with my
two deputies, and the forty horse that I was allowed, would, with what
speede wee could, make ourselves ready to go up to the Wastes, and
there wee would entrench ourselves, and lye as near as wee could to
the outlawes; and, if there were any brave spirits among them, that
would go with us, they should be very wellcome, and fare and lye as
well as myselfe: and I did not doubte before the summer ended, to do
something that should abate the pride of these outlawes. Those, that
were unwilling to hazard themselves, liked not this motion. They said,
that, in so doing, I might keep the countrey quiet the time I lay
there; but, when the winter approached, I could stay there no longer,
and that was the theeves' time to do all their mischiefe. But there
were divers young gentlemen, that offered to go with mee, some with
three, some with four horses, and to stay with mee as long as I would
there continue. I took a list of those that offered to go with mee,
and found, that, with myself, my officers, the gentlemen, and our
<span class="newpage"><a name="page108" id="page108">[108]</a></span>
servants, wee should be about two hundred good men and horse; a
competent number, as I thought, for such a service.</p>

<p>The day and place was appointed for our meeting in the Wastes, and,
by the help of the foot of Liddisdale<a name="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> and Risdale, wee had soone
built a pretty fort, and within it wee had all cabines made to lye in,
and every one brought beds or matresses to lye on. There wee stayed,
from the middest of June, till almost the end of August. We were
betweene fifty and sixty gentlemen, besides their servants and my
horsemen; so that wee were not so few as two hundred horse. Wee wanted
no provisions for ourselves nor our horses, for the countrey people
were well payed for any thing they brought us; so that wee had a good
market every day, before our fort, to buy what we lacked. The chiefe
outlawes, at our coming, fled their houses where they dwelt, and
betooke themselves to a large and great forest (with all their
goodes), which was called the Tarras. It was of that strength, and
so surrounded with bogges and marish grounds, and thicke bushes
and shrubbes, as they feared not the force nor power of England nor
Scotland, so long as they were there. They sent me word, that I was
like the first puffe of a haggasse,<a name="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> hottest at the first, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page109" id="page109">[109]</a></span>
bade me stay there as long as the weather would give me leave. They
would stay in the Tarras Wood till I was weary of lying in the Waste;
and when I had had my time, and they no whit the worse, they would
play their parts, which should keep mee waking the next winter. Those
gentlemen of the countrey that came not with mee, were of the same
minde; for they knew (or thought at least), that my force was not
sufficient to withstand the furey of the outlawes. The time I stayed
at the fort I was not idle, but cast, by all meanes I could, how to
take them in the great strength they were in. I found a meanes to send
a hundred and fifty horsemen into Scotland (conveighed by a muffled
man,<a name="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> not known to any of the company), thirty miles within
Scotland, and the businesse was carried so, that none in the countrey
tooke any alarm at this passage. They were quietly brought to
the back-side of the Tarras, to Scotland-ward. There they divided
themselves into three parts, and tooke up three passages which the
outlawes made themselves secure of, if from England side they should
at any time be put at.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page110" id="page110">[110]</a></span>
<p>They had their scoutes on the tops of hills, on the English side,
to give them warning if at any time any power of men should come to
surprise them. The three ambushes were safely laid, without being
discovered, and, about four o'clock in the morning, there were three
hundred horse, and a thousand foote,<a name="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> that came directly to the
place where the scoutes lay. They gave the alarm; our men brake down
as fast as they could into the wood. The outlawes thought themselves
safe, assuring themselves at any time to escape; but they were so
strongly set upon, on the English side, as they were forced to
leave their goodes, and betake themselves to their passages towards
Scotland. There was presently five taken of the principall of them.
The rest, seeing themselves, as they thought, betrayed, retired into
the thicke woodes and bogges,<a name="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> that our men durst not follow them
for fear of loosing themselves. The principall of the five, that were
taken, were two of the eldest sonnes of <i>Sim of Whitram</i>. These
five they brought to mee to the fort, and a number of goodes, both of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page111" id="page111">[111]</a></span>
sheep and kine, which satisfied most part of the countrey, that they
had stolen them from.</p>

<p>&quot;The five, that were taken, were of great worth and value amongst
them; insomuch, that, for their liberty, I should have what conditions
I should demand or desire. First, all English prisoners were set at
liberty. Then had I themselves, and most part of the gentlemen of the
Scottish side, so strictly bound in bondes to enter to mee, in fifteen
dayes warning, any offendour, that they durst not, for their
lives, break any covenant that I made with them; and so, upon these
conditions, I set them at liberty, and was never after troubled with
these kind of people. Thus God blessed me in bringing this great
trouble to so quiet an end; wee brake up our fort, and every man
retired to his owne house.&quot;&mdash;<i>Carey's Memoirs</i>, p. 151.</p>

<p>The people of Liddesdale have retained, by tradition, the remembrance
of <i>Carey's Raid</i>, as they call it. They tell, that, while he was
besieging the outlaws in the Tarras they contrived, by ways known
only to themselves, to send a party into England, who plundered the
warden's lands. On their return, they sent Carey one of his own cows,
telling him, that, fearing he might fall short of provision during his
visit to Scotland, they had taken the precaution of sending him some
English beef. The anecdote is too characteristic to be suppressed.</p>

<p>From this narrative, the power and strength of the Armstrongs, at
this late period, appear to have been very considerable. Even upon the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page112" id="page112">[112]</a></span>
death of Queen Elizabeth, this clan, associated with other banditti of
the west marches to the number of two or three hundred horse, entered
England in a hostile manner, and extended their ravages as far as
Penrith. James VI., then at Berwick, upon his journey to his new
capital, detached a large force, under Sir William Selby, captain of
Berwick, to bring these depredators to order. Their raid, remarkable
for being the last of any note occurring in history, was avenged in an
exemplary manner. Most of the strong-holds upon the Liddel were razed
to the foundation, and several of the principal leaders executed at
Carlisle; after which we find little mention of the Armstrongs in
history. The precautions, adopted by the Earl of Dunbar, to preserve
peace on the borders, bore peculiarly hard upon a body of men, long
accustomed to the most ungoverned licence. They appear, in a
great measure, to have fallen victims to the strictness of the new
enactments.&mdash;<i>Ridpath</i>, p. 703.&mdash;<i>Stow</i>, 819.&mdash;<i>Laing</i>,
Vol. I. The lands, possessed by them in former days, have chiefly come
into the hands of the Buccleuch family, and of the Elliots; so that,
with one or two exceptions, we may say, that, in the country which
this warlike clan once occupied, there is hardly left a land-holder of
the name. One of the last border reivers was, however, of this family,
and lived within the beginning of the last century. After having
made himself dreaded over the whole country, he at last came to the
following end: One&mdash;, a man of large property, having lost twelve cows
<span class="newpage"><a name="page113" id="page113">[113]</a></span>
in one night, raised the country of Tiviotdale, and traced the robbers
into Liddesdale, as far as the house of this Armstrong, commonly
called <i>Willie of Westburnflat</i>, from the place of his residence,
on the banks of the Hermitage water. Fortunately for the pursuers
he was then asleep; so that he was secured, along with nine of his
friends, without much resistance. He was brought to trial at Selkirk;
and, although no precise evidence was adduced to convict him of the
special fact (the cattle never having been recovered), yet the jury
brought him in <i>guilty</i> on his general character, or, as it is
called in our law, on habite and repute. When sentence was pronounced,
Willie arose; and, seizing the oaken chair in which he was placed,
broke it into pieces by main strength, and offered to his companions,
who were involved in the same doom, that, if they would stand behind
him, he would fight his way out of Selkirk with these weapons.
But they held his hands, and besought him to let them <i>die like
Christians</i>. They were accordingly executed in form of law. This
was the last trial at Selkirk. The people of Liddesdale, who (perhaps
not erroneously) still consider the sentence as iniquitous, remarked,
that&mdash;, the prosecutor, never throve afterwards, but came to beggary
and ruin, with his whole family.</p>

<p>Johnie Armstrong, of Gilnockie, the hero of the following ballad, is a
noted personage, both in history and tradition. He was, it would seem
from the ballad, a brother of the laird of Mangertoun, chief of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page114" id="page114">[114]</a></span>
the name. His place of residence (now a roofless tower) was at the
Hollows, a few miles from Langholm, where its ruins still serve to
adorn a scene, which, in natural beauty, has few equals in Scotland.
At the head of a desperate band of freebooters, this Armstrong is said
to have spread the terror of his name almost as far as Newcastle, and
to have levied <i>black mail</i>, or <i>protection and forbearance
money</i>, for many miles around. James V., of whom it was long
remembered by his grateful people, that he made the &quot;rush-bush keep
the cow,&quot; about 1529, undertook an expedition through the border
counties, to suppress the turbulent spirit of the marchmen. But,
before setting out upon his journey, he took the precaution of
imprisoning the different border chieftains, who were the chief
protectors of the marauders. The Earl of Bothwell was forfeited,
and confined in Edinburgh castle. The lords of Home and Maxwell, the
lairds of Buccleuch, Fairniherst, and Johnston, with many others,
were also committed to ward. Cockburn of Henderland, and Adam Scott
of Tushielaw, called the King of the Border, were publicly
executed.&mdash;<i>Lesley</i>, p. 430. The king then marched rapidly
forward, at the head of a flying army of ten thousand men, through
Ettrick Forest, and Ewsdale. The evil genius of our Johnie Armstrong,
or, as others say, the private advice of some courtiers, prompted
him to present himself before James, at the head of thirty-six horse,
arrayed in all the pomp of border chivalry, Pitscottie uses nearly the
words of the ballad, in describing the splendour of his equipment,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page115" id="page115">[115]</a></span>
and his high expectations of favour from the king. &quot;But James, looking
upon him sternly, said to his attendants, 'What wants that knave that
a king should have?' and ordered him and his followers to instant
execution.&quot;&mdash;&quot;But John Armstrong,&quot; continues this minute historian,
&quot;made great offers to the king. That he should sustain himself, with
forty gentlemen, ever ready at his service, on their own cost, without
wronging any Scottishman: Secondly, that there was not a subject in
England, duke, earl, or baron, but, within a certain day, he should
bring him to his majesty, either quick or dead.<a name="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> At length he,
seeing no hope of favour, said very proudly, 'It is folly to seek
grace at a graceless face; but,' said he, 'had I known this, I should
have lived upon the borders in despite of King Harry and you both; for
<span class="newpage"><a name="page116" id="page116">[116]</a></span>
I know King Harry would <i>down-weigh my best horse with gold</i>,
to know that I were condemned to die this day.'&mdash;<i>Pitscottie's
History</i>, p. 145. Johnie, with all his retinue, was accordingly
hanged upon growing trees, at a place called Carlenrig chapel, about
ten miles above Hawick, on the high road to Langholm. The country
people believe, that, to manifest the injustice of the execution,
the trees withered away. Armstrong and his followers were buried in a
deserted church-yard, where their graves are still shewn.</p>

<p>As this border hero was a person of great note in his way, he is
frequently alluded to by the writers of the time. Sir David Lindsay
of the Mount, in the curious play published by Mr. Pinkerton, from the
Bannatyne MS., introduces a pardoner, or knavish dealer in reliques,
who produces, among his holy rarities&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>&mdash;The cordis, baith grit and lang,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Quhilt hangit Johnnie Armistrang,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Of gude hempt, soft and sound,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Gude haly pepill, I stand ford,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Wha'evir beis hangit in this cord,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Neidis nevir to be drowned!</i></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Pinkerton's Scottish Poems</i>, Vol. II. p. 69.</span><br />

<p>In <i>The Complaynt of Scotland</i>, John Armistrangis's dance,
mentioned as a popular tune, has probably some reference to our hero.</p>

<p>The common people of the high parts of Tiviotdale, Liddesdale, and
the country adjacent, hold the memory of Johnie Armstrong in very high
<span class="newpage"><a name="page117" id="page117">[117]</a></span>
respect. They affirm also, that one of his attendants broke through
the king's guard, and carried to Gilnockie Tower the news of the
bloody catastrophe.</p>

<p>This song was first published by Allan Ramsay, in his
<i>Evergreen</i>, who says, he copied it from the mouth of a
gentleman, called Armstrong, who was in the sixth generation from this
John. The reciter assured him, that this was the genuine old ballad;
the common one false. By the common one, Ramsay means an English
ballad upon the same subject, but differing in various particulars,
which is published in Mr. Ritson's <i>English Songs</i>, Vol. II. It
is fortunate for the admirers of the old ballad, that it did not fall
into Ramsay's hands, when he was equipping with new sets of words the
old Scottish tunes in his <i>Tea-Table Miscellany</i>. Since his time
it has been often reprinted.</p>

<p>The lands, here mentioned, were the possessions of Armstrong himself,
the investitures of which not having been regularly renewed, the
feudal casualty of non-entry had been incurred by the vassal. The
brother of Johnie Armstrang is said to have founded, or rather
repaired, Langholm castle, before which, as mentioned in the ballad,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page128" id="page128">[128]</a></span>
verse 5th, they &quot;ran their horse,&quot; and &quot;brake their spears,&quot; in the
exercise of border chivalry.&mdash;<i>Account of the Parish of Langholm,
apud Macfarlane's MSS</i>. The lands of Langholm and Staplegorton
continued in Armstrong's family; for there is, in the same MS.
collection, a similar bond of manrent, granted by &quot;Christofer
Armistrang, calit <i>Johne's Pope</i>,&quot; on 24th January, 1557, to Lord
Johne Lord Maxwell, and to Sir Johne Maxwell of Terreglis, knight, his
tutor and governor, in return for the gift of &quot;the males of all and
haill the landis whilk are conteint in ane bond made by umquhile Johne
Armistrang, my father, to umquhile Robert, Lord Maxwell, gudshore to
the said Johne, now Lord Maxwell.&quot; It would therefore appear, that the
bond of manrent, granted by John Armstrong, had been the price of his
release from the feudal penalty arising from his having neglected
to procure a regular investiture from his superior. As Johnie only
touched the pen, it appears that he could not write.</p>

<p>Christopher Armstrong, above-mentioned, is the person alluded to in
the conclusion of the ballad&mdash;&quot;God be with thee, Kirsty, my son.&quot;
He was the father, or grandfather, of William Armstrong, called
<i>Christie's Will</i>, a renowned freebooter, some of whose exploits
the reader will find recorded in the third volume of this work.</p>

<h4>NOW FIRST PUBLISHED.</h4>

<p><i>The castle of Lochmaben was formerly a noble building, situated
upon a peninsula, projecting into one of the four lakes which are in
the neighbourhood of the royal burgh, and is said to have been the
residence of Robert Bruce, while lord of Annandale. Accordingly,
it was always held to be a royal fortress, the keeping of which,
according to the custom of the times, was granted to some powerful
lord, with an allotment of lands and fishings, for the defence and
maintenance of the place. There is extant a grant, dated 16th March,
1511, to Robert Lauder of the Bass, of the office of captain and
keeper of Lochmaben castle, for seven years, with many perquisites.
Among others, the</i> &quot;land, stolen frae the king,&quot; <i>is bestowed
upon the captain, as his proper lands.&mdash;What shall we say of a
country, where the very ground was the subject of theft</i>?</p>

<a name="NOTES_ON_THE_LOCHMABEN_HARPER"></a><h3>NOTES ON THE LOCHMABEN HARPER.</h3>
<br />

<p>The only remark which offers itself on the foregoing ballad seems
to be, that it is the most modern in which the harp, as a border
instrument of music, is found to occur.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss the subject of Lochmaben, without noticing an
extraordinary and anomalous class of landed proprietors, who dwell
in the neighbourhood of that burgh. These are the inhabitants of four
small villages, near the ancient castle, called the Four Towns of
Lochmaben. They themselves are termed the King's Rentallers, or kindly
tenants; under which denomination each of them has a right, of an
allodial nature, to a small piece of ground. It is said, that these
people are the descendants of Robert Bruce's menials, to whom he
assigned, in reward of their faithful service, these portions of land,
burdened only with the payment of certain quit-rents, and grassums or
fines, upon the entry of a new tenant. The right of the rentallers is,
in essence, a right of property, but, in form, only a right of lease;
of which they appeal for the foundation on the rent-rolls of the lord
of the castle and manor. This possession, by rental, or by simple
entry upon the rent-roll, was anciently a common, and peculiarly
sacred, species of property, granted by a chief to his faithful
<span class="newpage"><a name="page135" id="page135">[135]</a></span>
followers; the connection of landlord and tenant being esteemed of
a nature too formal to be necessary, where there was honour upon
one side, and gratitude upon the other. But, in the case of subjects
granting a right of this kind, it was held to expire with the life
of the granter, unless his heir chose to renew it; and also upon
the death of the rentaller himself, unless especially granted to his
heirs, by which term only his first heir was understood. Hence, in
modern days, the <i>kindly tenants</i> have entirely disappeared
from the land. Fortunately for the inhabitants of the Four Towns of
Lochmaben, the maxim, that the king can never die, prevents their
right of property from reverting to the crown. The viscount of
Stormonth, as royal keeper of the castle, did, indeed, about the
beginning of last century, make an attempt to remove the rentallers
from their possessions, or at least to procure judgment, finding them
obliged to take out feudal investitures, and subject themselves to the
casualties thereto annexed. But the rentallers united in their common
defence; and, having stated their immemorial possession, together with
some favourable clauses in certain old acts of parliament, enacting,
that the king's <i>poor kindly tenants</i> of Lochmaben should not be
hurt, they finally prevailed in an action before the Court of Session.
From the peculiar state of their right of property, it follows, that
there is no occasion for feudal investitures, or the formal entry of
an heir; and, of course, when they chuse to convey their lands, it is
done by a simple deed of conveyance, without charter or sasine.</p>

<p>The kindly tenants of Lochmaben live (or at least lived till lately)
much sequestered from their neighbours, marry among themselves, and
are distinguished from each other by <i>soubriquets</i>, according to
the ancient border custom, repeatedly noticed You meet, among their
writings, with such names as <i>John Out-bye, Will In-bye, White-fish,
Red-fish</i>, &amp;c. They are tenaciously obstinate in defence of their
privileges of commonty, &amp;c. which are numerous. Their lands are,
in general, neatly inclosed, and well cultivated, and they form a
contented and industrious little community.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page136" id="page136">[136]</a></span>
<p>Many of these particulars are extracted from the MSS. of Mr. Syme,
writer to the signet. Those, who are desirous of more information, may
consult <i>Craig de Feudis</i>, Lib. II. dig. 9. sec. 24. It is hoped
the reader will excuse this digression, though somewhat professional;
especially as there can be little doubt, that this diminutive republic
must soon share the fate of mightier states; for, in consequence of
the increase of commerce, lands possessed under this singular tenure,
being now often brought to sale, and purchased by the neighbouring
proprietors, will, in process of time, be included in their
investitures, and the right of rentallage be entirely forgotten.</p>

<p><i>There is another ballad, under the same title as the following, in
which nearly the same incidents are narrated, with little difference,
except that the honour of rescuing the cattle is attributed to the
Liddesdale Elliots, headed by a chief, there called Martin Elliot of
the Preakin Tower, whose son, Simon, is said to have fallen in the
action. It is very possible, that both the Tiviotdale Scotts, and the
Elliots were engaged in the affair, and that each claimed the honour
of the victory</i>.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>It was laigh down in Borthwick water</i>.&mdash;P. 140. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>Borthwick water is a stream, which falls into the Tiviot, three miles
above Hawick.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>But, gin ye'll gae to the fair Dodhead</i>.&mdash;P. 140. v. 2.</span><br />

<p>The Dodhead, in Selkirkshire, near Singlee, where there are still the
vestiges of an old tower.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Now Jamie Telfer's heart was sair</i>.&mdash;P. 140. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>There is still a family of Telfers, residing near Langholm, who
pretend to derive their descent from the Telfers of the Dodhead.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Between the Dodhead and the Stobs's Ha'</i>.&mdash;P. 141. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>Stobs Hall, upon Slitterick. Jamie Telfer made his first application
<span class="newpage"><a name="page149" id="page149">[149]</a></span>
here because he seems to have paid the proprietor of that castle
<i>black-mail</i>, or protection-money.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Gar seek your succour at Branksome Ha'</i>.&mdash;P. 141. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>The ancient family-seat of the lairds of Buccleuch, near Hawick.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Till he cam to the Coultart Cleugh</i>.&mdash;P. 142. v. 2.</span><br />

<p>The Coultart Cleugh is nearly opposite to Carlinrig, on the road
between Hawick and Mosspaul.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Gar warn the water, braid and wide</i>.&mdash;P. 144. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>The water, in the mountainous districts of Scotland, is often used to
express the banks of the river, which are the only inhabitable parts
of the country. <i>To raise the water</i>, therefore, was to alarm
those who lived along its side.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Warn Wat o' Harden, and his sons</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;P. 144. v. 5.</span><br />

<p>The estates, mentioned in this verse, belonged to families of the name
of Scott, residing upon the waters of Borthwick and Tiviot, near the
castle of their chief.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Ride by the gate at Priesthaughswire</i>.&mdash;P. 145. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>The pursuers seem to have taken the road through the hills of
Liddesdale, in order to collect forces, and intercept the foragers
at the passage of the Liddel, on their return to Bewcastle. The
Ritterford and Kershope-ford, after mentioned, are noted fords on the
river Liddel.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The gear was driven the Frostylee up</i>.&mdash;P. 145. v. 3.</span><br />

<p>The Frostylee is a brook, which joins the Tiviot, near Mosspaul.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And Harden grat for very rage</i>.&mdash;P. 146. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>Of this border laird, commonly called <i>Auld Wat of Harden</i>,
tradition has preserved many anecdotes. He was married to Mary Scott,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page150" id="page150">[150]</a></span>
celebrated in song by the title of the Flower of Yarrow. By their
marriage-contract, the father-in-law, Philip Scott of Dryhope, was to
find Harden in horse meat, and man's meat, at his tower of Dryhope,
for a year and a day; but five barons pledge themselves, that, at
the expiry of that period, the son-in-law should remove, without
attempting to continue in possession by force! A notary-public signed
for all the parties to the deed, none of whom could write their names.
The original is still in the charter-room of the present Mr. Scott of
Harden. By the Flower of Yarrow the laird of Harden had six sons;
five of whom survived him, and founded the families of Harden (now
extinct), Highchesters (now representing Harden), Reaburn, Wool, and
Synton. The sixth son was slain at a fray, in a hunting-match, by the
Scotts of Gilmanscleugh. His brothers flew to arms; but the old laird
secured them in the dungeon of his tower, hurried to Edinburgh, stated
the crime, and obtained a gift of the lands of the offenders from the
crown. He returned to Harden with equal speed, released his sons, and
shewed them the charter. &quot;To horse, lads!&quot; cried the savage warrior,
&quot;and let us take possession! the lands of Gilmanscleuch are well worth
a dead son.&quot; The property, thus obtained, continued in the family
till the beginning of last century, when it was sold, by John Scott of
Harden, to Anne, Duchess of Buccleuch.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>John o' Brigham there was slane</i>.&mdash;P. 147. v. 3.</span><br />

<p>Perhaps one of the ancient family of Brougham, in Cumberland. The
editor has used some freedom with the original in the subsequent
verse. The account of the captain's disaster <i>(tests laeva
vulnerata</i>) is rather too <i>naive</i> for literal publication.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Cried&mdash;&quot;On for his house in Stanegirthside</i>.&mdash;P. 148. v. 3.</span><br />

<a name="THE_RAID_OF_THE_REIDSWIRE."></a><h2>THE RAID OF THE REIDSWIRE.</h2>
<br />

<p>This poem is published from a copy in the Bannatyne MS. in the
hand-writing of the Hon. Mr. Carmichael, advocate. It first appeared
in <i>Allan Ramsay's Evergreen</i>, but some liberties have been taken
by him in transcribing it; and, what is altogether unpardonable,
the MS., which is itself rather inaccurate, has been interpolated to
favour his readings; of which there remain obvious marks.</p>

<p>The skirmish of the Reidswire happened upon the 7th of June, 1575,
at one of the meetings, held by the wardens of the marches, for
arrangements necessary upon the border. Sir John Carmichael, ancestor
of the present Earl of Hyndford, was the Scottish warden, and Sir John
Forster held that office on the English middle march.&mdash;In the course
of the day, which was employed, as usual, in redressing wrongs, a
bill, or indictment, at the instance of a Scottish complainer, was
fouled (<i>i.e.</i> found a true bill) against one Farnstein, a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page153" id="page153">[153]</a></span>
notorious English freebooter. Forster alleged that he had fled from
justice: Carmichael considering this as a pretext to avoid making
compensation for the felony, bade him &quot;play fair!&quot; to which the
haughty English warden retorted, by some injurious expressions
respecting Carmichael's family, and gave other open signs of
resentment. His retinue, chiefly men of Reesdale and Tynedale, the
most ferocious of the English borderers, glad of any pretext for
a quarrel, discharged a flight of arrows among the Scots. A warm
conflict ensued, in which, Carmichael being beat down and made
prisoner, success seemed at first to incline to the English side; till
the Tynedale men, throwing themselves too greedily upon the plunder,
fell into disorder; and a body of Jedburgh citizens arriving at that
instant, the skirmish terminated in a complete victory on the part
of the Scots, who took prisoners, the English warden, James Ogle,
Cuthbert Collingwood, Francis Russel, son to the Earl of Bedford, and
son-in-law to Forster, some of the Fenwicks, and several other
border chiefs. They were sent to the Earl of Morton, then regent,
who detained them at Dalkeith for some days, till the heat of their
resentment was abated; which prudent precaution prevented a
war betwixt the two kingdoms. He then dismissed them with great
expressions of regard; and, to satisfy Queen Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> sent up
Carmichael to York, whence he was soon after honourably dismissed.
<span class="newpage"><a name="page154" id="page154">[154]</a></span>
The field of battle, called the Reidswire, is a part of the Carter
Mountain, about ten miles from Jedburgh.&mdash;See, for these particulars,
<i>Godscroft, Spottiswoode</i>, and <i>Johnstone's History</i>.</p>

<p>The editor has adopted the modern spelling of the word Reidswire, to
prevent the mistake in pronunciation which might be occasioned by
the use of the Scottish <i>qu</i> for <i>w</i>. The MS. reads
<i>Reidsquair. Swair</i>, or <i>Swire</i>, signifies the descent of
a hill; and the epithet <i>Red</i> is derived from the colour of
the heath, or, perhaps, from the Reid-water, which rises at no great
distance.</p>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Carmichael was our warden then</i>.&mdash;P. 157. v. 2.</span><br />
<br />

<p>Sir John Carmichael was a favourite of the resent Morton, by whom
he was appointed warden of the middle marches, in preference to the
border chieftains. With the like policy, the regent married Archibald
Carmichael, the warden's brother, to the heiress of Edrom, in the
Merse, much contrary to the inclination of the lady and her friends.
In like manner, he compelled another heiress, Jane Sleigh, of Cumlege,
to marry Archibald, brother to Auchinleck of Auchiuleck, one of his
dependants. By such arbitrary practices, Morton meant to strengthen
his authority on the borders; instead of which, he hastened his fall,
by giving disgust to his kinsman the Earl of Angus, and his
other friends, who had been established in the country for
ages.&mdash;<i>Godscroft</i>, Vol. II. Pages 238. 246. Sir John Carmichael,
the warden, was murdered 16th June, 1600, by a party of borderers, at
a place called Raesknows, near Lochmaben, whither he was going to hold
a court of justice. Two of the ring-leaders in the slaughter, Thomas
Armstrong, called <i>Ringan's Tarn</i>, and Adam Scott, called <i>the
Pecket</i>, were tried at Edinburgh, at the instance of Carmichael
of Edrom. They were condemned to have their right hands struck off,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page164" id="page164">[164]</a></span>
thereafter to be hanged, and their bodies gibbeted on the Borough
Moor; which sentence was executed, 14th November, 1601. &quot;This
<i>Pecket</i>, (saith Birrel in his <i>Diary</i>), was ane of the
maist notalrie thieftes that ever raid:&quot; he calls his name Steill,
which appears, from the record, to be a mistake. Four years
afterwards, an Armstrong, called <i>Sandy of Rowanburn</i>, and
several others of that tribe, were executed for this and other
excesses.&mdash;<i>Books of Adjournal of these dates</i>.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And the Laird's Wat, that worthie man</i>.&mdash;P. 157. v. 2.</span><br />

<p>The chief, who led out the sirname of Scott upon this occasion, was
(saith Satchells) Walter Scott of Ancrum, a natural son of Walter of
Buccleuch. The laird of Buccleuch was then a minor. The ballad seems
to have been popular in Satchells' days, for he quotes it literally.
He must, however, have been mistaken in this particular; for the
family of Scott of Ancrum, in all our books of genealogy, deduce their
descent from the Scotts of Balwearie in Fife, whom they represent.
The first of this family, settled in Roxburghshire, is stated in
<i>Douglas' Baronage</i> to have been Patrick Scott, who purchased the
lands of Ancrum, in the reign of James VI. He therefore could not be
the <i>Laird's Wat</i> of the ballad; indeed, from the list of border
families in 1597, Ker appears to have been proprietor of Ancrum at the
date of the ballad. It is plainly written in the MS. the <i>Laird's
Wat</i>, i.e., the Laird's son Wat; notwithstanding which, it has
always hitherto been printed the <i>Laird Wat</i>. If Douglas be
accurate in his genealogy, the person meant must be the young laird
of Buccleuch, afterwards distinguished for his surprise of Carlisle
Castle.&mdash;See <i>Kinmont Willie</i>. I am the more confirmed in this
opinion, because Kerr of Ancrum was at this time a fugitive, for
slaying one of the Rutherfords, and the tower of Ancrum given in
keeping to the Turnbulls, his hereditary enemies. His mother, however,
a daughter of Home of Wedderburn, contrived to turn out the Turnbulls,
and possess herself of the place by surprise.&mdash;<i>Godscroft</i>, Vol.
II. p. 250.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page165" id="page165">[165]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The Armestranges, that aye hae been</i>.&mdash;P. 158. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>This clan are here mentioned as not being hail, or whole, because
they were outlawed or broken men. Indeed, many of them had become
Englishmen, as the phrase then went. Accordingly, we find, from Paton,
that forty of them, under the laird of Mangertoun, joined Somerset
upon his expedition into Scotland.&mdash;<i>Paton, in Dalyell's
Fragments</i>, p. 1. There was an old alliance betwixt the Elliots and
Armstrongs, here alluded to. For the enterprises of the Armstrongs,
against their native country, when under English assurance, see
<i>Murdin's State Papers</i>, Vol. I. p. 43. From which it appears,
that, by command of Sir Ralph Evers, this clan ravaged almost the
whole west border of Scotland.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The sheriffe brought the Douglas down</i>.&mdash;P. 158. v. 2,</span><br />

<p>Douglas of Cavers, hereditary sheriff of Teviotdale, descended from
Black Archibald, who carried the standard of his father, the Earl
of Douglas, at the battle of Otterbourne.&mdash;<i>See the Ballad of that
name</i>.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Wi' Cranstane, Gladstain, good at need</i>.&mdash;P. 158. v. 2.</span><br />

<p>Cranstoun of that ilk, ancestor to Lord Cranstoun; and Gladstain of
Gladstains.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Wi a' the Trumbills, stronge and stout;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>The Rutherfoords, with grit renown</i>.&mdash;P. 158. v. 2.</span><br />

<p>These were ancient and powerful border clans, residing chiefly upon
the river Jed. Hence, they naturally convoyed the town of Jedburgh
out. Although notorious freebooters, they were specially patronised by
Morton, who, by their means, endeavoured to counterpoise the power
of Buccleuch and Ferniherst, during the civil wars attached to the
queen's faction.</p>

<p>The following fragment of an old ballad is quoted in a letter from
an aged gentleman of this name, residing at New-York, to a friend in
Scotland:</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page166" id="page166">[166]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Bauld Rutherfurd, he was fow stout, Wi' a' his nine sons</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">him round about; He led the town o' Jedburgh out, All bravely</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">fought that day.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Wi' Sir John Forster for their guyde</i>.&mdash;P. 158. v. 3.</span><br />

<p>This gentleman is called, erroneously, in some copies of this ballad,
<i>Sir George</i>. He was warden of the mid-marches of England.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Wi' Sir George Henroune of Schipsydehouse</i>.&mdash;P. 159. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>Sir George Heron of Chipchase-house, whose character is contrasted
with that of the English warden.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Had Tindaill, Reedsdaill at his hand</i>.&mdash;P. 159. v. 2.</span><br />

<p>These are districts, or dales, on the English border. Hebsrime seems
to be an error in the MS. for Hebburn upon the Till.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Five hundred Fennicks in a flock</i>.&mdash;P. 159. v. 3.</span><br />

<p>The Fenwicks; a powerful and numerous Northumberland clan.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Then raise the slogan with ane shout</i>.&mdash;P. 161. v. 3.</span><br />

<p>The gathering word, peculiar to a certain name, or set of people, was
termed <i>slogan</i>, or <i>slughorn</i>, and was always repeated
at an onset, as well as on many other occasions, as appears from the
following passage of an old author, whom this custom seems much to
have offended&mdash;for he complains,</p>

<p>&quot;That whereas alweys, both in al tounes of war, and in al campes of
armies, quietnes and stilnes without nois is principally in the night,
after the watch is set, observed (I need not reason why.) Yet,
our northern prikkers, the borderers, notwithstanding, with great
enormitie, (as thought me) and not unlyke (to be playn) unto a
masterless hounde houyling in a hie wey, when he hath lost him he
wayted upon, sum hoopyng, sum whistelyng, and most with crying, a
<i>Berwyke</i>! a <i>Berwyke</i>! a <i>Fenwyke</i>! a <i>Fenwyke</i>!
<span class="newpage"><a name="page167" id="page167">[167]</a></span>
a <i>Bulmer</i>! a <i>Bulmer</i>! or so ootherwise as theyr captein's
names wear, never linnde those troublous and daungerous noyses all
the night long. They sayd they did it to fynd out their captein and
fellowes; but if the soldiours of our oother countries and sheres had
used the same maner, in that case we shoold have oftymes had the state

<p>Honest Patten proceeds, with great prolixity, to prove, that this was
a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance; and, like
Fluellen, declares, &quot;that such idle pribble prabbles were contrary to
all the good customs and disciplines of war.&quot; Nevertheless, the custom
of crying the <i>slogan</i> or <i>ensenzie</i>, is often alluded to
in all our ancient histories and poems. It was usually the name of the
clan, or place of rendezvous, or leader. In 1335, the English, led
by Thomas of Rosslyne, and William Moubray, assaulted Aberdeen. The
former was mortally wounded in the onset; and, as his followers
were pressing forward, shouting <i>Rosslyne! Rosslyne</i>! &quot;Cry
<i>Moubray</i>,&quot; said the expiring chieftain; &quot;<i>Rosslyne</i> is
gone!&quot; The Highland clans had also their appropriate slogans.
The Macdonalds cried <i>Frich</i>, (heather); the Macphersons
<i>Craig-Ubh</i>; the Grants <i>Craig-Elachie</i>; and the Macfarlanes
<i>Lock-Sloy</i>.</p>

<p>The Scots, on this occasion, seem to have had chiefly fire-arms; the
English retaining still their partiality for their ancient weapon,
the long-bow. It also appears, by a letter from the Duke of Norfolk to
Cecil, that the English borderers were unskilful in fire-arms, or,
as he says, &quot;our countrymen be not so commyng with shots as I woolde

<p>In the following rude strains, our forefathers commemorated one of the
last, and most gallant atchievements, performed upon the border. The
reader will find, in the subjoined extract from Spottiswoode, a minute
historical account of the exploit; which is less different from that
contained in the ballad than might perhaps have been expected.</p>

<p><i>Anno, 1596</i>.&mdash;&quot;The next year began with a trouble in the
borders, which was like to have destroyed the peace betwixt the two
realms, and arose upon this occasion. The Lord Scroop being the warden
of the west marches of England, and the laird of Bacleuch having the
charge of Liddesdale, they sent their deputies to keep a day of truce,
for redress of some ordinary matters.&mdash;The place of meeting was at
the Dayholme of Kershop, where a small brook divideth England from
Scotland, and Liddesdale from Bawcastle. There met, as deputy for the
laird of Bacleuch, Robert Scott of Hayninge; and for the Lord Scroop,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page172" id="page172">[172]</a></span>
a gentleman within the west wardenry, called Mr. Salkeld. These two,
after truce taken and proclaimed, as the custom was, by sound of
trumpet, met friendly, and, upon mutual redress of such wrongs as were
then complained of, parted in good terms, each of them taking his
way homewards. Meanwhile it happened, one William Armstrong, commonly
called <i>Will of Kinmonth</i>, to be in company with the Scottish
deputy, against whom the English had a quarrel, for many wrongs he had
committed, as he was indeed a notorious thief. This man, having taken
his leave of the Scots deputy, and riding down the river of Liddel on
the Scottish side, towards his own house, was pursued by the English,
who espied him from the other side of the river, and, after a chase of
three or four miles, taken prisoner, and brought back to the English
deputy, who carried him away to the castle of Carlisle.</p>

<p>&quot;The laird of Bacleuch complaining of the breach of truce (which
was always taken from the time of meeting, unto the next day at
sun-rising), wrote to Mr. Salkeld, and craved redress. He excused
himself by the absence of the Lord Scroop. Whereupon Bacleuch sent
to the Lord Scroop, and desired the prisoner might be set at liberty,
without any bond or condition, seeing he was unlawfully taken.
Scroop answered, that he could do nothing in the matter, it having so
happened, without a direction from the queen and council of England,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page173" id="page173">[173]</a></span>
considering the man was such a malefactor.&mdash;Bacleuch, loth to inform
the king of what was done, lest it might have bred some misliking
betwixt the princes, dealt with Mr. Bowes, the resident ambassador of
England, for the prisoner's liberty; who wrote very seriously to the
Lord Scroop in that business, advising him to set the man free,
and not to bring the matter to a farther hearing. But no answer was
returned: the matter thereupon was imparted to the king, and the queen
of England solicited by letters to give direction for his liberty; yet
nothing was obtained; which Bacleuch perceiving, and apprehending both
the king, and himself as the king's officer, to be touched in honour,
he resolved to work the prisoner's relief, by the best means he could.</p>

<p>&quot;And, upon intelligence that the castle of Carlisle, wherein the
prisoner was kept, was surprisable, he employed some trusty persons to
take a view of the postern gate, and measure the height of the wall,
which he meant to scale by ladders, and, if those failed, to break
through the wall with some iron instruments, and force the gates. This
done, so closely as he could, he drew together some two hundred horse,
assigning the place of meeting at the tower of Morton, some ten miles
from Carlisle, an hour before sun-set. With this company, passing the
water of Esk, about the falling, two hours before day, he crossed Eden
beneath Carlisle bridge (the water, through the rain that had fallen,
being thick), and came to the Sacery, a plain under the castle. There
<span class="newpage"><a name="page174" id="page174">[174]</a></span>
making a little halt, at the side of a small bourn, which they call
Cadage, he caused eighty of the company to light from their horses,
and take the ladders, and other instruments which he had prepared,
with them. He himself, accompanying them to the foot of the wall,
caused the ladders to be set to it, which proving too short, he gave
order to use the other instruments for opening the wall nigh the
postern; and, finding the business likely to succeed, retired to the
rest whom he had left on horseback, for assuring those that entered
upon the castle against any eruption from the town. With some little
labor a breach was made for single men to enter, and they who first
went in, broke open the postern for the rest. The watchmen, and some
few the noise awaked, made a little restraint, but they were quickly
repressed, and taken captive. After which, they passed to the chamber
wherein the prisoner was kept; and, having brought him forth, sounded
a trumpet, which was a signal to them without that the enterprize was
performed. My Lord Scroope and Mr. Salkeld were both within the house,
and to them the prisoner cried &quot;a good night!&quot; The captives taken in
the first encounter were brought to Bacleuch, who presently returned
them to their master, and would not suffer any spoil, or booty, as
they term it, to be carried away; he had straitly forbidden to break
open any door, but that where the prisoner was kept, though he might
have made prey of all the goods within the castle, and taken the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page175" id="page175">[175]</a></span>
warden himself captive; for he would have it seen, that he did intend
nothing but the reparation of his majesty's honor. By this time, the
prisoner was brought forth, the town had taken the alarm, the drums
were beating, the bells ringing, and a beacon put on the top of the
castle, to give warning to the country. Whereupon Bacleuch commanded
those that entered the castle, and the prisoner, to horse; and
marching again by the Sacery, made to the river at the Stony-bank, on
the other side, whereof certain were assembled to stop his passage;
but he, causing to sound the trumpet, took the river, day being then
broken, and they choosing to give him way, he retired in order
through the Grahams of Esk (men at that time of great power, and
his un-friends), and came back into Scottish ground two hours after
sun-rising, and so homewards.</p>

<p>&quot;This fell out the 13th of April, <i>1596</i>. The queen of England,
having notice sent her of what was done, stormed not a little. One of
her chief castles surprised, a prisoner taken forth of the hands of
the warden, and carried away, so far within England, she esteemed a
great affront. The lieger, Mr. Bowes, in a frequent convention kept at
Edinburgh, the 22d of May, did, as he was charged, in a long oration,
aggravate the heinousness of the fact, concluding that peace could not
longer continue betwixt the two realms, unless Bacleuch were
delivered in England, to be punished at the queen's pleasure. Bacleuch
<span class="newpage"><a name="page176" id="page176">[176]</a></span>
compearing, and charged with the fact, made answer&mdash;'That he went not
into England with intention to assault any of the queen's houses, or
to do wrong to any of her subjects, but only to relieve a subject of
Scotland unlawfully taken, and more unlawfully detained; that, in the
time of a general assurance, in a day of truce, he was taken prisoner
against all order, neither did he attempt his relief till redress
was refused; and that he had carried the business in such a moderate
manner, as no hostility was committed, nor the least wrong offered to
any within the castle; yet was he content, according to the ancient
treaties observed betwixt the two realms, when as mutual injuries were
alleged, to be tried by the commissioners that it should please their
majesties to appoint, and submit himself to that which they should
decern.'&mdash;The convention, esteeming the answer reasonable, did
acquaint the ambassador therewith, and offered to send commissioners
to the borders, with all diligence, to treat with such as the queen
should be pleased to appoint for her part.</p>

<p>&quot;But she, not satisfied with the answer, refused to appoint any
commissioners; whereupon the council of England did renew the
complaint in July thereafter; and the business being of new agitated,
it was resolved of as before, and that the same should be remitted to
the trial of commissioners: the king protesting, 'that he might,
with great reason, crave the delivery of Lord Scroope, for the injury
committed by his deputy, it being less favourable to take a prisoner,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page177" id="page177">[177]</a></span>
than relieve him that is unlawfully taken; yet, for the continuing of
peace, he would forbear to do it, and omit nothing, on his part,
that could be desired, either in equity, or by the laws of
friendship.'&mdash;The borders, in the mean time, making daily incursions
one upon another, filled all their parts with trouble, the English
being continually put to the worse; neither were they made quiet,
till, for satisfying the queen, the laird of Bacleuch was first
committed in St. Andrews, and afterwards entered in England, where he
remained not long<a name="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>.&quot;&mdash;<i>Spottiswood's History of the Church of
Scotland</i>, p. 414, 416, <i>Ed. 1677</i>.</p>

<p>Scott of Satchells, in the extraordinary poetical performance, which
he has been pleased to entitle <i>A History of the Name of Scott</i>
(published 1688), dwells, with great pleasure, upon this gallant
achievement, at which, it would seem, his father had been present. He
also mentions, that the laird of Buccleuch employed the services of
the younger sons and brothers only of his clan, lest the name should
have been weakened by the landed men incurring forfeiture. But he
adds, that three gentlemen of estate insisted upon attending their
chief, notwithstanding this prohibition. These were, the lairds
<span class="newpage"><a name="page178" id="page178">[178]</a></span>
of Harden and Commonside, and Sir Gilbert Elliot of the Stobbs, a
relation of the laird of Buccleuch, and ancestor to the present Sir
William Elliot, Bart. In many things Satchells agrees with the ballads
current in his time, from which, in all probability, he derived most
of his information as to past events, and from which he sometimes
pirates whole verses, as noticed in the annotations upon the <i>Raid
of the Reidswire</i>. In the present instance, he mentions the
prisoner's <i>large spurs</i> (alluding to the fetters), and some
other little incidents noticed in the ballad, which was, therefore,
probably well known in his days.</p>

<p>All contemporary historians unite in extolling the deed itself as the
most daring and well-conducted atchievement of that age. &quot;<i>Audax
facinus cum modica manu, in urbe maenibus et multitudine
oppidanorum munita, et callidae: audaciae, vix ullo obsisti modo
potuit</i>.&quot;&mdash;<i>Johnstoni Historia, Ed. Amstael. p</i>. 215. Birrel,
in his gossipping way, says, the exploit was performed &quot;with shouting
and crying, and sound of trumpet, puttand the said toun and countrie
in sic ane fray, that the like of sic ane wassaladge wes nevir done
since the memory of man, no not in Wallace dayis.&quot;&mdash;<i>Birrel's
Diary</i>, April 6, 1596. This good old citizen of Edinburgh also
mentions another incident which I think proper to insert here, both as
relating to the personages mentioned in the following ballad, and
as tending to shew the light in which the men of the border were
regarded, even at this late period, by their fellow subjects. The
<span class="newpage"><a name="page179" id="page179">[179]</a></span>
author is talking of the king's return to Edinburgh, after the
disgrace which he had sustained there, during the riot excited by the
seditious ministers, on December 17, 1596. Proclamation had been
made, that the Earl of Mar should keep the West Port, Lord Seton the
Nether-Bow, and Buccleuch, with sundry others, the High Gate. &quot;Upon
the morn, at this time, and befoir this day, thair wes ane grate
rumour and word among the tounesmen, that the kinges M. sould send in
<i>Will Kinmond, the common thieffe</i>, and so many southland men
as sould spulye the toun of Edinburgh. Upon the whilk, the haill
merchants tuik thair haill gear out of their buiths or chops, and
transportit the same to the strongest hous that wes in the toune, and
remained in the said hous, thair, with thameselfis, thair servants,
and luiking for nothing bot that thai sould have been all spulyeit.
Sic lyke the hail craftsmen and comons convenit themselfis, thair
best guides, as it wer ten or twelve householdes in are, whilk wes the
strongest hous, and might be best kepit from spuilyeing or burning,
with hagbut, pistolet, and other sic armour, as might best defend
thameselfis. Judge, gentill reider, giff this wes playing.&quot; The
fear of the borderers being thus before the eyes of the contumacious
citizens of Edinburgh, James obtained a quiet hearing for one of his
favourite orisones, or harangues, and was finally enabled to prescribe
terms to his fanatic metropolis. Good discipline was, however,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page180" id="page180">[180]</a></span>
maintained by the chiefs upon this occasion; although the fears of the
inhabitants were but too well grounded, considering what had happened
in Stirling ten years before, when the Earl of Angus, attended by
Home, Buccleuch, and other border chieftains, marched thither to
remove the Earl of Arran from the king's councils: the town was
miserably pillaged by the borderers, particularly by a party of
Armstrongs, under this very Kinmont Willie, who not only made prey
of horses and cattle, but even of the very iron grating of
the windows.&mdash;<i>Johnstoni Historia</i>, p. 102. <i>Ed.
Amstael</i>.&mdash;<i>Moyse's Memoirs</i>, p. 100.</p>

<p>The renown of Kinmont Willie is not surprising, since, in 1588, the
apprehending that freebooter, and Robert Maxwell, natural-brother to
the Lord Maxwell, was the main, but unaccomplished, object of a
royal expedition to Dumfries. &quot;<i>Rex ... Robertum Maxvallium ... et
Gulielmum Armstrangum Kinmonthum latrociniis intestinis externisque
famosum, conquiri jubet. Missi e ministerio regio, qui per aspera
loca vitabundos persequuntur, magnoque incommodo afficiunt. At illi
latebris aut silvis se eripiunt.&quot;&mdash;Johnstoni Historia</i>, p. 138.
About this time, it is possible that Kinmont Willie may have held
some connection with the Maxwells, though afterwards a retainer to
Buccleuch, the enemy of that tribe. At least, the editor finds,
that, in a bond of manrent, granted by Simon Elliot of Whytheuch,
in Liddesdale, to Lord Maxwell, styled therein Earl of Morton, dated
February 28, 1599, William Armstrang, called <i>Will of Kinmond</i>,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page181" id="page181">[181]</a></span>
appears as a witness.&mdash;<i>Syme's MSS</i>. According to Satchells,
this freebooter was descended of Johnie Armstrong of Gilnockie (See
<i>Ballad, p. 105, of this volume</i>.)&mdash;<i>Est in juvencis, est et
in equis, patrum virtus</i>. In fact, his rapacity made his very name
proverbial. Mas James Melvine, in urging reasons against subscribing
the act of supremacy, in 1584, asks ironically, &quot;Who shall take order
with vice and wickedness? The court and bishops? As well as
Martine Elliot, and Will of Kinmont, with stealing upon the
borders!&quot;&mdash;<i>Calderwood</i>, p. 168.</p>

<p>This affair of Kinmont Willie was not the only occasion upon which the
undaunted keeper of Liddesdale gave offence to the haughty Elizabeth.
For, even before this business was settled, certain of the English
borderers having invaded Liddesdale, and wasted the country, the laird
of Buccleuch retaliated the injury by a <i>raid</i> into England, in
which he not only brought off much spoil, but apprehended
thirty-six of the Tynedale thieves, all of whom he put to
death.&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode</i>, p. 450. How highly the Queen of England's
resentment blazed on this occasion, may be judged from the preface to
her letter to Bowes, then her ambassador in Scotland. &quot;I wonder how
base-minded that king thinks me, that, with patience, I can digest
this dishonourable &mdash;&mdash;. Let him know, therefore, that I will have
satisfaction, or else &mdash;&mdash;.&quot; These broken words of ire are inserted
betwixt the subscription and the address of the letter.&mdash;<i>Rymer</i>,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page182" id="page182">[182]</a></span>
Vol. XVI. p. 318. Indeed, so deadly was the resentment of the English,
on account of the affronts put upon them by this formidable chieftain,
that there seems at one time to have been a plan formed (not, as
was alleged, without Elizabeth's privity,) to assassinate
Buccleuch.&mdash;<i>Rymer</i>, Vol. XVI. p. 107. The matter was at length
arranged by the commissioners of both nations in Berwick, by whom it
was agreed that delinquents should be delivered up on both sides,
and that the chiefs themselves should enter into ward in the opposite
countries, till these were given up, and pledges granted for the
future maintenance of the quiet of the borders. Buccleuch, and Sir
Robert Ker of Cessford (ancestor of the Duke of Roxburgh), appear to
have struggled hard against complying with this regulation; so much
so, that it required all James's authority to bring to order these
two powerful chiefs.&mdash;<i>Rymer</i>, Vol. XVI. p.
322.&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode</i>, p. 448.&mdash;<i>Carey's Memoirs</i>, p, 131.
<i>et sequen</i>.&mdash;When at length they appeared, for the purpose of
delivering themselves up to be warded at Berwick, an incident took
place, which nearly occasioned a revival of the deadly feud which
formerly subsisted between the Scots and the Kers. Buccleuch had
chosen, for his guardian, during his residence in England, Sir William
Selby, master of the ordnance at Berwick, and accordingly gave himself
into his hands. Sir Robert Ker was about to do the same, when a pistol
was discharged by one of his retinue, and the cry of treason was
raised. Had not the Earl of Home been present, with a party of Merse
<span class="newpage"><a name="page183" id="page183">[183]</a></span>
men, to preserve order, a dreadful tumult would probably have ensued.
As it was, the English commissioners returned in dismay to Berwick,
much disposed to wreak their displeasure on Buccleuch; and he, on
his side, mortally offended with Cessford, by whose means, as he
conceived, he had been placed in circumstances of so much danger. Sir
Robert Ker, however, appeased all parties, by delivering himself up
to ward in England; on which occasion, he magnanimously chose for
his guardian Sir Robert Carey, deputy-warden of the east marches,
notwithstanding various causes of animosity which existed betwixt
them. The hospitality of Carey equalled the generous confidence of
Cessford, and a firm friendship was the consequence<a name="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a>.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page184" id="page184">[184]</a></span>
<p>Buccleuch appears to have remained in England from October, 1597, till
February, 1598.&mdash;<i>Johnstoni Historia</i>, p. 231,&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode,
ut supra</i>. According to ancient family tradition, Buccleuch was
presented to Elizabeth, who, with her usual rough and peremptory
address, demanded of him, &quot;how he dared to undertake an enterprize
so desperate and presumptuous.&quot; &quot;What is it,&quot; answered the undaunted
chieftain, &quot;What is it that a man dares not do!&quot; Elizabeth, struck
with the reply, turned to a lord in waiting; &quot;With ten thousand such
men,&quot; said she, &quot;our brother of Scotland might shake the firmest
throne of Europe.&quot; Luckily, perhaps, for the murtheress of Queen Mary,
James's talents did not lie that way.</p>

<p>The articles, settled by the commissioners at Berwick, were highly
favourable to the peace of the border. They may be seen at large in
the <i>Border Laws</i>, p. 103. By article sixth, all wardens and
keepers are discharged from seeking reparation of injuries, in the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page185" id="page185">[185]</a></span>
ancient hostile mode of riding, or causing to ride, in warlike manner,
against the opposite march; and that under the highest penalty, unless
authorized by a warrant under the hand of their sovereign. The mention
of the word <i>keeper</i>, alludes obviously to the above-mentioned
reprisals, made by Buccleuch in the capacity of keeper of Liddesdale.</p>

<p>This ballad is preserved, by tradition, on the west borders, but much
mangled by reciters; so that some conjectural emendations have been
absolutely necessary to render it intelligible. In particular, the
<i>Eden</i> has been substituted for the <i>Eske</i>, p. 193, the
latter name being inconsistent with geography.</p>

<p>The Salkeldes, or Sakeldes, were a powerful family in Cumberland,
possessing, among other manors, that of Corby, before it came into
the possession of the Howards, in the beginning of the seventeenth
century. A strange stratagem was practised by an outlaw, called Jock
Grame of the Peartree, upon Mr. Salkelde, sheriff of Cumberland; who
is probably the person alluded to in the ballad, as the fact is
stated to have happened late in Elizabeth's time. The brother of this
<span class="newpage"><a name="page197" id="page197">[197]</a></span>
freebooter was lying in Carlisle jail for execution, when Jock of the
Peartree came riding past the gate of Corby castle. A child of the
sheriff was playing before the door, to whom the outlaw gave an apple,
saying, &quot;Master, will you ride?&quot; The boy willingly consenting, Grame
took him up before him, carried him into Scotland, and would never
part with him, till he had his brother safe from the gallows. There is
no historical ground for supposing, either that Salkelde, or any one
else, lost his life in the raid of Carlisle.</p>

<p>In the list of border clans, 1597, Will of Kinmonth, with Kyrstie
Armestrange, and John Skynbanke, are mentioned as leaders of a band
of Armstrongs, called <i>Sandies Barnes</i>, inhabiting the Debateable
Land. The ballad itself has never before been published.</p>

<a name="DICK_O_THE_COW"></a><h2>DICK O' THE COW.</h2>
<br />

<p>This ballad, and the two which immediately follow it in the
collection, were published, 1784, in the <i>Hawick Museum</i>, a
provincial miscellany, to which they were communicated by John Elliot,
Esq. of Reidheugh, a gentleman well skilled in the antiquities of
the western border, and to whose friendly assistance the editor is
indebted for many valuable communications.</p>

<p>These ballads are connected with each other, and appear to have been
composed by the same author. The actors seem to have flourished, while
Thomas, Lord Scroope, of Bolton, was warden of the west marches of
England, and governor of Carlisle castle; which offices he acquired
upon the death of his father, about 1590; and retained it till the
union of the crowns.</p>

<p><i>Dick of the Cow</i>, from the privileged insolence which he
assumes, seems to have been Lord Scroope's jester. In the preliminary
dissertation, the reader will find the border custom of assuming
<i>noms de guerre</i> particularly noticed. It is exemplified in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page199" id="page199">[199]</a></span>
the following ballad, where one Armstrong is called the <i>Laird's
Jock</i> (i.e. the laird's son Jock), another <i>Fair Johnie</i>,
a third <i>Billie Willie</i> (brother Willie), &amp;c. The <i>Laird's
Jock</i>, son to the laird of Mangerton, appears, as one of the men of
name in Liddesdale, in the list of border clans, <i>1597</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dick of the Cow</i> is erroneously supposed to have been the
same with one Ricardus Coldall, de Plumpton, a knight and celebrated
warrior, who died in 1462, as appears from his epitaph in the church
of Penrith.&mdash;<i>Nicolson's History of Westmoreland and Cumberland</i>,
Vol. II. p. 408.</p>

<p>This ballad is very popular in Liddesdale; and the reciter always
adds, at the conclusion, that poor Dickie's cautious removal to Burgh
under Stanemore, did not save him from the clutches of the Armstrongs;
for that, having fallen into their power several years after this
exploit, he was put to an inhuman death. The ballad was well known
in England, so early as 1556. An allusion to it likewise occurs in
<i>Parrot's Laquei Ridiculosi</i>, or <i>Springes for Woodcocks</i>;
London, 1613.</p>

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But lend me thy bay,&quot; fair Johnie can say;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He has ta'en a steil cap on his head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gallopped on to follow Dickie.</span><br />
<span class="newpage"><a name="page207" id="page207">[207]</a></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dickie was na a mile frae aff the town,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wat a mile but barely three,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he was o'erta'en by fair Johnie Armstrang,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hand for hand, on Cannobie lee.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Abide, abide, thou traitour thief!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The day is come that thou maun die.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Dickie look't owre his left shoulder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said&mdash;&quot;Johnie, hast thou nae mae in cumpanie?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;There is a preacher in our chapell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a' the live lang day teaches he:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When day is gane, and night is come,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's ne'er ae word I mark but three.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;The first and second is&mdash;Faith and Conscience;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The third&mdash;Ne'er let a traitour free:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, Johnie, what faith and conscience was thine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When thou took awa my three ky frae me?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And when thou had ta'en awa my three ky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou thought in thy heart thou wast not weil sped,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till thou sent thy billie Willie ower the know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To take thrie coverlets off my wife's bed!&quot;</span><br />
<span class="newpage"><a name="page208" id="page208">[208]</a></span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Johnie let a speir fa' laigh by his thie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thought well to hae slain the innocent, I trow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the powers above were mair than he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he ran but the puir fule's jerkin through.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Together they ran, or ever they blan;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This was Dickie the fule and he!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dickie could na win at him wi' the blade o' the sword,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But fell'd him wi' the plummet under the e'e.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus Dickie has fell'd fair Johnie Armstrang,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The prettiest man in the south country&mdash;-</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Gramercy!&quot; then can Dickie say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;I had but twa horse, thou hast made me thrie!&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's ta'en the steil jack aff Johnie's back,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The twa-handed sword that hang low by his thie;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's ta'en the steil cap aff his head&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Johnie, I'll tell my master I met wi' thee.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Johnie wakened out o' his dream,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wat a dreirie man was he:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;And is thou gane? Now, Dickie, than</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I ne'er shall fight wi' a fule after thee.&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Dickie's come hame to the gude Lord Scroope,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E'en as fast as he might his;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Now, Dickie, I'll neither eat nor drink,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;But what garr'd thee steal the Laird's Jock's horse?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, limmer, what garr'd ye steal him?&quot; quo' he;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;For lang thou mightst in Cumberland dwelt,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Then Dickie's come on to Pudding-burn house</i>.&mdash;P. 205. v, 3.</span><br />

<p>This was a house of strength, held by the Armstrongs. The ruins at
present form a sheep-fold, on the farm of Reidsmoss, belonging to the
Duke of Buccleuch.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>He has tied them a' wi' St. Mary's knot</i>.&mdash;P. 207. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>Hamstringing a horse is termed, in the border dialect, <i>tying him
with St. Mary's Knot</i>. Dickie used this cruel expedient to prevent
a pursuit. It appears from the narration, that the horses, left
unhurt, belonged to Fair Johnie Armstrang, his brother Willie, and the
Laird's Jock, of which Dickie carried off two, and left that of the
Laird's Jock, probably out of gratitude for the protection he had
afforded him on his arrival.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Hand for hand, on Cannobie lee</i>.&mdash;P. 209. v. 1.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Ere the Laird's Jock had stown frae thee</i>.&mdash;P. 211. v. 4.</span><br />

<p>The commendation of the Laird's Jock's honesty seems but indifferently
founded; for, in July 1586, a bill was fouled against him, Dick of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page214" id="page214">[214]</a></span>
Dryup, and others, by the deputy of Bewcastle, at a warden-meeting,
for 400 head of cattle taken in open forray from the Drysike in
Bewcastle: and, in September 1587, another complaint appears at the
instance of one Andrew Rutledge of the Nook, against the Laird's Jock,
and his accomplices, for 50 kine and oxen, besides furniture, to
the amount of 100 merks sterling. See Bell's MSS., as quoted in
the <i>History of Cumberland and Westmoreland</i>. In Sir Richard
Maitland's poem against the thieves of Liddesdale, he thus
commemorates the Laird's Jock:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They spuilye puir men of thair pakis,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They leif them nocht on bed nor bakis;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The <i>Lairdis Jock</i></span><br />

<br />

<p>The subject of this ballad, being a common event in those troublesome
and disorderly times, became a favourite theme of the ballad-makers.
There are, in this collection, no fewer than three poems on the rescue
of prisoners, the incidents in which nearly resemble each other;
though the poetical description is so different, that the editor did
not think himself at liberty to reject any one of them, as borrowed
from the others. As, however, there are several verses, which, in
recitation, are common to all these three songs, the editor, to
prevent unnecessary and disagreeable repetition, has used the freedom
of appropriating them to that, in which they seem to have the best
poetic effect.</p>

<p>The reality of this story rests solely upon the foundation of
tradition. Jock o' the side seems to have been nephew to the laird
of Mangertoun, cousin to the Laird's Jock, one of his deliverers, and
<span class="newpage"><a name="page216" id="page216">[216]</a></span>
probably brother to Chrystie of the Syde, mentioned in the list of
border clans 1597. Like the Laird's Jock, he also is commemorated by
Sir Richard Maitland.&mdash;See the <i>Introduction</i>.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is weil kend, Johne of the Syde,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ouir gude ane guide.</span><br />

<p>The land-serjeant, mentioned in this ballad, and also in that of
<i>Hobble Noble</i>, was an officer under the warden, to whom was
committed the apprehending of delinquents, and the care of the public
peace.</p>

<p>We have seen the hero of this ballad act a distinguished part in the
deliverance of Jock o' the Side, and are now to learn the ungrateful
return which the Armstrongs made him for his faithful services.<a name="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a>
Halbert, or Hobbie Noble, appears to have been one of those numerous
English outlaws, who, being forced to fly their own country, had
established themselves on the Scottish borders. As Hobbie continued
his depredations upon the English, they bribed some of his hosts, the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page226" id="page226">[226]</a></span>
Armstrongs, to decoy him into England, under pretence of a predatory
expedition. He was there delivered, by his treacherous companions,
into the hands of the officers of justice, by whom he was conducted to
Carlisle, and executed next morning. The laird of Mangerton, with whom
Hobbie was in high favour, is said to have taken a severe revenge upon
the traitors who betrayed him. The principal contriver of the scheme,
called here Sim o' the Maynes, fled into England from the resentment
of his chief; but experienced there the common fate of a traitor,
being himself executed at Carlisle, about two months after Hobbie's
death. Such is, at least, the tradition of Liddesdale. Sim o' the
Maynes appears among the Armstrongs of Whitauch, in Liddesdale, in the
list of clans so often alluded to.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page227" id="page227">[227]</a></span>
<p>Kershope-burn, where Hobbie met his treacherous companions, falls
into the Liddel, from the English side, at a place called Turnersholm,
where, according to tradition, turneys and games of chivalry were
often solemnized. The Mains was anciently a border-keep, near
Castletoun, on the north side of the Liddel, but is now totally
demolished.</p>

<p>Askerton is an old castle, now ruinous, situated in the wilds of
Cumberland, about seventeen miles north-east of Carlisle, amidst that
mountainous and desolate tract of country, bordering upon Liddesdale,
emphatically termed the Waste of Bewcastle. Conscouthart Green, and
Rodric-haugh, and the Foulbogshiel, are the names of places in the
same wilds, through which the Scottish plunderers generally made their
raids upon England; as appears from the following passage in a
letter from William, Lord Dacre, to Cardinal Wolsey, 18th July, 1528;
<i>Appendix to Pinkerton's Scotland</i>, v. 12, No. XIX. &quot;Like it also
your grace, seeing the disordour within Scotlaund, and that all the
mysguyded men, borderers of the same, inhabiting within Eskdale,
Ewsdale, Walghopedale, Liddesdale, and a part of Tividale, foranempt
Bewcastelldale, and a part of the middle marches of this the
king's bordours, entres not this west and middle marches, to do any
attemptate to the king our said soveraine's subjects: but thaye come
throrow Bewcastelldale, and retornes, for the most part, the same waye
agayne.&quot;</p>

<p>Willeva and Speir Edom are small districts in Bewcastledale, through
<span class="newpage"><a name="page228" id="page228">[228]</a></span>
which also the Hartlie-burn takes its course.</p>

<p>Of the castle of Mangertoun, so often mentioned in these ballads,
there are very few vestiges. It was situated on the banks of the
Liddel, below Castletoun. In the wall of a neighbouring mill, which
has been entirely built from the ruins of the tower, there is a
remarkable stone, bearing the arms of the lairds of Mangertoun, and
a long broad-sword, with the figures 1583; probably the date of
building, or repairing, the castle. On each side of the shield are
the letters S.A. and E.E. standing probably for Simon Armstrong,
and Elizabeth Elliot. Such is the only memorial of the laird of
Mangertoun, except those rude ballads, which the editor now offers to
the public.</p>

king's commissioners of the northern counties, that a certain number
of slough-hounds should be maintained in every district of Cumberland,
bordering upon Scotland. They were of great value, being sometimes
sold for a hundred crowns. <i>Exposition of Bleau's Atlas, voce

<p>It may perhaps be thought, that, from the near resemblance which this
ballad bears to Kinmont Willie, and Jock o' the Side, the editor might
have dispensed with inserting it in this collection. But, although
the incidents in these three ballads are almost the same, yet there
is considerable variety in the language; and each contains minute
particulars, highly characteristic of border manners, which it is the
object of this publication to illustrate. Ca'field, or Calfield, is
a place in Wauchopdale, belonging of old to the Armstrongs. In the
account betwixt the English and Scottish marches, Jock and Geordie
of Ca'field, there called Calfhill, are repeatedly marked as
delinquents.&mdash;<i>History of Westmoreland and Cumberland</i>, Vol.
I. <i>Introduction</i>, p. 33. &quot;<i>Mettled John Hall, from the laigh
Tiviotdale</i>,&quot; is perhaps John Hall of Newbigging, mentioned in the
list of border clans, as one of the chief men of name residing on the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page239" id="page239">[239]</a></span>
middle marches in 1597. The editor has been enabled to add several
stanzas to this ballad, since publication of the first edition.
They were obtained from recitation; and, as they contrast the brutal
indifference of the elder brother with the zeal and spirit of his
associates, they add considerably to the dramatic effect of the whole.</p>

<a name="THE_FRAY_OF_SUPORT"></a><h2>THE FRAY OF SUPORT.</h2>
<h4>AN ANCIENT BORDER GATHERING SONG FROM TRADITION.</h4>
<br />

<p>Of all the border ditties, which have fallen into the editor's hands,
this is by far the most uncouth and savage. It is usually chaunted in
a sort of wild recitative, except the burden, which swells into a long
and varied howl, not unlike to a view hollo'. The words, and the
very great irregularity of the stanza (if it deserves the name),
sufficiently point out its intention and origin. An English woman,
residing in Suport, near the foot of the Kershope, having been
plundered in the night by a band of the Scottish moss-troopers, is
supposed to convoke her servants and friends for the pursuit, or
<i>Hot Trod</i>; upbraiding them, at the same time, in homely phrase,
for their negligence and security. The <i>Hot Trod</i> was followed by
the persons who had lost goods, with blood-hounds and horns, to raise
<span class="newpage"><a name="page249" id="page249">[249]</a></span>
the country to help. They also used to carry a burning wisp of straw
at a spear head, and to raise a cry, similar to the Indian war-whoop.
It appears, from articles made by the wardens of the English marches,
September 12th, in 6th of Edward VI. that all, on this cry being
raised, were obliged to follow the fray, or chace, under pain of
death. With these explanations, the general purport of the ballad
may be easily discovered, though particular passages have become
inexplicable, probably through corruptions introduced by reciters. The
present copy is corrected from four copies, which differed widely from
each other.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Wi' his sleuth dog sits in his watch right sure</i>.&mdash;P 256. v. 1.</span><br />

<p>The centinels, who, by the march laws, were planted upon the border

<span class="newpage"><a name="page256" id="page256">[256]</a></span>
them.&mdash;See <i>Nicolson's Border Laws</i>, and <i>Lord Wharton's
Regulations, in the 6th of Edward VI</i>.</p>

<p>Of the blood-hound we have said something in the notes on <i>Hobbie
Noble</i>; but we may, in addition, refer to the following poetical
description of the qualities and uses of that singular animal:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Upon the banks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Tweed, slow winding thro' the vale, the seat</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of war and rapine once, ere Britons knew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweets of peace, or Anna's dread commands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To lasting leagues the haughty rivals awed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There dwelt a pilfering race; well trained and skill'd</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all the mysteries of theft, the spoil</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their only substance, feuds and war their sport.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not more expert in every fraudful art</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The arch felon was of old, who by the tail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drew back his lowing prize: in vain his wiles,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In vain the shelter of the covering rock,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In vain the sooty cloud, and ruddy flames,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That issued from his mouth; for soon he paid</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His forfeit life: a debt how justly due</span><br />

<a name="LORD_MAXWELLS_GOODNIGHT"></a><h2>LORD MAXWELL'S GOODNIGHT.</h2>

<h3>NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</h3>
<br />

<p>This beautiful ballad is published from a copy in Glenriddel's MSS.,
with some slight variations from tradition. It alludes to one of the
most remarkable feuds upon the west marches.</p>

<p>A.D. 1585, John, Lord Maxwell, or, as he styled himself, Earl of
Morton, having quarrelled with the Earl of Arran, reigning favourite
of James VI., and fallen, of course, under the displeasure of the
court, was denounced rebel. A commission was also given to the laird
of Johnstone, then warden of the west-marches, to pursue and apprehend
the ancient rival and enemy of his house. Two bands of mercenaries,
commanded by Captains Cranstoun and Lammie, who were sent from
Edinburgh to support Johnstone, were attacked and cut to pieces
at Crawford-muir by Robert Maxwell, natural brother to the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page259" id="page259">[259]</a></span>
chieftain;<a name="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> who, following up his advantage, burned Johnstone's
castle of Lochwood, observing, with savage glee, that he would
give Lady Johnstone light enough by which to &quot;set her hood.&quot; In
a subsequent conflict, Johnstone himself was defeated, and made
prisoner, and is said to have died of grief at the disgrace which he
sustained.&mdash;See <i>Spottiswoode</i> and <i>Johnstone's Histories</i>,
and <i>Moyse's Memoirs, ad annum</i> 1585.</p>

<p>By one of the revolutions, common in those days, Maxwell was soon
after restored to the king's favour, in his turn, and obtained the
wardenry of the west marches. A bond of alliance was subscribed by
him, and by Sir James Johnstone, and for some time the two clans
lived in harmony. In the year 1593, however, the hereditary feud was
revived, on the following occasion: A band of marauders, of the clan
Johnstone, drove a prey of cattle from the lands belonging to the
lairds of Crichton, Sanquhar, and Drumlanrig; and defeated,
with slaughter, the pursuers, who attempted to rescue their
property.&mdash;[<i>See the following Ballad and Introduction</i>.] The
injured parties, being apprehensive that Maxwell would not cordially
embrace their cause, on account of his late reconciliation with the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page260" id="page260">[260]</a></span>
Johnstones, endeavoured to overcome his reluctance, by ottering
to enter into bonds of manrent, and so to become his followers
and liegemen; he, on the other hand, granting to them a bond of
maintenance, or protection, by which he bound himself, in usual form,
to maintain their quarrel against all mortals, saving his loyalty.
Thus, the most powerful and respectable families in Dumfries-shire
became, for a time, the vassals of Lord Maxwell. This secret alliance
was discovered to Sir James Johnstone by the laird of Cummertrees,
one of his own clan, though a retainer to Maxwell. Cummertrees
even contrived to possess himself of the bonds of manrent, which he
delivered to his chief. The petty warfare betwixt the rival barons was
instantly renewed. Buccleuch, a near relation of Johnstone, came to
his assistance with his clan, &quot;the most renowned freebooters (says
a historian), the fiercest and bravest warriors, among the border
tribes&quot;<a name="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> With Buccleuch also came the Elliots, Armstrongs, and
Graemes. Thus reinforced, Johnstone surprised and cut to pieces a
party of the Maxwells, stationed at Lochmaben. On the other hand,
Lord Maxwell, armed with the royal authority, and numbering among his
followers all the barons of Nithesdale, displayed his banner as the
king's lieutenant, and invaded Annandale, at the head of 2000 men. In
<span class="newpage"><a name="page261" id="page261">[261]</a></span>
those days, however, the royal auspices to have carried as little good
fortune as effective strength with them. A desperate conflict, still
renowned in tradition, took place at the Dryffe sands, not far from
Lockerby, in which Johnstone, although inferior in numbers, partly by
his own conduct, partly by the valour of his allies, gained a decisive
victory. Lord Maxwell, a tall man, and heavily armed, was struck from
his horse in the flight, and cruelly slain, after the hand, which he
stretched out for quarter, had been severed from his body. Many of
his followers were slain in the battle, and many cruelly wounded;
especially by slashes in the face, which wound was thence termed a
&quot;<i>Lockerby lick</i>.&quot; The barons of Lag, Closeburn, and Drumlanrig,
escaped by the fleetness of their horses; a circumstance alluded to in
the following ballad.</p>

<p>This fatal battle was followed by a long feud, attended with all the
circumstances of horror, proper to a barbarous age. Johnstone, in his
diffuse manner, describes it thus: &quot;<i>Ab eo die ultro citroque
in Annandia et Nithia magnis utriusque regionis jacturis certatum.
Caedes, incendia, rapinae, et nefanda facinora; liberi in maternis
gremiis trucidati; mariti in conspectu conjugum suarum, incensae
villae lamentabiles ubique querimoniae et horribiles armorum
fremitus</i>.&quot; JOHNSTONI <i>Historia, Ed. Amstael</i>. p. 182.</p>

<p>John, Lord Maxwell, with whose <i>Goodnight</i> the reader is here
presented, was son to him who fell at the battle of Dryffe Sands,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page262" id="page262">[262]</a></span>
and is said to have early vowed the deepest revenge for his father's
death. Such, indeed, was the fiery and untameable spirit of the man,
that neither the threats nor entreaties of the king himself could make
him lay aside his vindictive purpose; although Johnstone, the object
of his resentment, had not only reconciled himself to the court, but
even obtained the wardenry of the middle-marches, in room of Sir John
Carmichael, murdered by the Armstrongs. Lord Maxwell was therefore
prohibited to approach the border counties; and having, in contempt of
that mandate, excited new disturbances, he was confined in the castle
of Edinburgh. From this fortress, however, he contrived to make his
escape; and, having repaired to Dumfries-shire, he sought an amicable
interview with Johnstone, under pretence of a wish to accommodate
their differences. Sir Robert Maxwell, of Orchardstane (mentioned
in the Ballad, verse 1.), who was married to a sister of Sir James
Johnstone, persuaded his brother-in-law to accede to Maxwell's
proposal. The two chieftains met, each with a single attendant, at a
place called Achmanhill, 6th April, 1608. A quarrel arising betwixt
the two gentlemen who attended them (Charles Maxwell, brother to the
laird of Kirkhouse, and Johnstone of Lockerby), and a pistol being
discharged, Sir James turned his horse to separate the combatants; at
which instant Lord Maxwell shot him through the back with a brace of
bullets, of which wound he died on the spot, after having for some
<span class="newpage"><a name="page263" id="page263">[263]</a></span>
time gallantly defended himself against Maxwell, who endeavoured to
strike him with his sword. &quot;A fact,&quot; saith Spottiswoode, &quot;detested by
all honest men, and the gentleman's misfortune severely lamented,
for he was a man full of wisdom and courage.&quot;&mdash;SPOTTISWOODE,
<i>Edition</i> 1677, <i>pages</i> 467, 504. JOHNSTONI <i>Historia, Ed.
Amstael</i>. pp. 254, 283, 449.</p>

<p>Lord Maxwell, the murderer, made his escape to France; but, having
ventured to return to Scotland, he was apprehended lurking in the
wilds of Caithness, and brought to trial at Edinburgh. The royal
authority was now much strengthened by the union of the crowns, and
James employed it in staunching the feuds of the nobility, with a
firmness which was no attribute of his general character. But, in the
best actions of that monarch, there seems to have been an unfortunate
tincture of that meanness, so visible on the present occasion.
Lord Maxwell was indicted for the murder of Johnstone; but this was
combined with a charge of <i>fire-raising</i>, which, according to the
ancient Scottish law, if perpetrated by a landed man, constituted a
species of treason, and inferred forfeiture. Thus, the noble purpose
of public justice was sullied, by being united with that of enriching
some needy favourite. John, Lord Maxwell, was condemned, and beheaded,
21st May, 1613. Sir Gideon Murray, treasurer-depute, had a great share
of his forfeiture; but the attainder was afterwards reversed, and
the honours and estate were conferred upon the brother of
the deceased.&mdash;LAING'S <i>History of Scotland</i>, Vol. I. p.
62.&mdash;JOHNSTONI <i>Historia</i>, p. 493.</p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page264" id="page264">[264]</a></span>
<p>The lady, mentioned in the ballad, was sister to the Marquis of
Hamilton, and, according to Johnstone the historian, had little reason
to regret being separated from her husband, whose harsh treatment
finally occasioned her death. But Johnstone appears not to be
altogether untinctured with the prejudices of his clan, and is
probably, in this instance, guilty of exaggeration; as the active
share, taken by the Marquis of Hamilton in favour of Maxwell, is a
circumstance inconsistent with such a report.</p>

<p>Thus was finally ended, by a salutary example of severity, the &quot;foul
debate&quot; betwixt the Maxwells and Johnstones, in the course of which
each family lost two chieftains; one dying of a broken heart, one in
the field of battle, one by assassination, and one by the sword of the
executioner.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable to believe, that the following ballad must have
been written before the death of Lord Maxwell, in 1613; otherwise
there would have been some allusion to that event. It must therefore
have been composed betwixt 1608 and that period.</p>

<p>The reader will perceive, from the Introduction, what connection the
bond, subscribed by Douglas of Drumlanrig, Kirkpatrick of Closeburn,
and Grierson of Lagg, had with the death of Lord Maxwell's father. For
the satisfaction of those, who may be curious as to the form of
these bonds, I have transcribed a letter of manrent,<a name="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> from a MS.
collection of upwards of twenty deeds of that nature, copied from the
originals by the late John Syme, Esq. writer to the signet; for
the use of which, with many other favours of a similar nature, I am
indebted to Dr. Robert Anderson of Edinburgh. The bond is granted by
Thomas Kirkpatrick of Closeburn, to Robert, Lord Maxwell, father of
him who was slain at the battle of the Dryffe Sands.</p>
<p></p>
<span class="newpage"><a name="page269" id="page269">[269]</a></span>
<h4>BOND OF MANRENT.</h4>

Edinburgh, 3d February, 1542.
</blockquote>
<p>In the collection, from which this extract is made, there are bonds
of a similar nature granted to Lord Maxwell, by Douglas of Drumlanrig,
ancestor of the Duke of Queensberry; by Crichton Lord Sanquhar,
ancestor of the earls of Dumfries, and many of his kindred; by
Stuart of Castlemilk; by Stuart of Garlies, ancestor of the earls
of Galloway; by Murray of Cockpool, ancestor of the Murrays, lords
Annandale; by Grierson of Lagg, Gordon of Lochmaben, and many other of
the most ancient and respectable barons in the south-west of Scotland,
binding themselves, in the most submissive terms, to become the
liegemen and the vassals of the house of Maxwell; a circumstance which
<span class="newpage"><a name="page270" id="page270">[270]</a></span>
must highly excite our idea of the power of that family. Nay, even
the rival chieftain, Johnstone of Johnstone, seems at one time to
have come under a similar obligation to Maxwell, by a bond, dated 11th
February 1528, in which reference is made to the counter-obligation of
the patron, in these words: &quot;Forasmeikle as the said lord has oblist
him to supple, maintene, and defend me, in the peciabill brouking and
joysing of all my landis, rentis, &amp;c. and to take my aefald, leill and
trew part, in all my good actionis, causis, and quarles, leiful and
honest, aganes all deedlie, his alledgeance to our soveraigne lord the
king allanerly excepted, as at mair length is contained in his lettres
of maintenance maid to me therupon; therfore, &amp;c.&quot; he proceeds to bind
himself as liegeman to the Maxwell.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss the subject without observing, that, in the dangerous
times of Queen Mary, when most of these bonds are dated, many barons,
for the sake of maintaining unanimity and good order, may have chosen
to enroll themselves among the clients of Lord Maxwell, then warden
of the border, from which, at a less turbulent period, personal
considerations would have deterred them.</p>

<p><i>Adieu! my castle of the Thrieve</i>.&mdash;P. 268. v. 2.</p>

<p>This fortress is situated in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, upon an
island about two acres in extent, formed by the river Dee. The walls
are very thick and strong, and bear the marks of great antiquity. It
was a royal castle; but the keeping of it, agreeable to the feudal
practice, was granted by charter, or sometimes by a more temporary and
precarious right, to different powerful families, together with lands
for their good service in maintaining and defending the place. This
office of heritable keeper remained with the Nithesdale family (chief
of the Maxwells) till their forfeiture, 1715. The garrison seems to
have been victualled upon feudal principles; for each parish in the
stewartry was burdened with the yearly payment of a <i>lardner mart
cow</i>, i.e. a cow fit for being killed and salted at Martinmas, for
winter provisions. The right of levying these cattle was retained by
<span class="newpage"><a name="page271" id="page271">[271]</a></span>
the Nithesdale family, when they sold the castle and estate, in
1704, and they did not cease to exercise it till their
attainder.&mdash;<i>Fountainhall's Decisions</i>, Vol. I. p. 688.</p>

<p>This same castle of the Thrieve was, A.D. 1451-2, the scene of an
outrageous and cruel insult upon the royal authority. The fortress was
then held by William VIII. Earl of Douglas, who, in fact, possessed a
more unlimited authority over the southern districts of Scotland,
than the reigning monarch. The earl had, on some pretence, seized
and imprisoned a baron, called Maclellan, tutor of Bombie, whom he
threatened to bring to trial, by his power of hereditary jurisdiction.
The uncle of this gentleman, Sir Patrick Gray of Foulis, who commanded
the body-guard of James II., obtained from that prince a warrant,
requiring from Earl Douglas the body of the prisoner. When Gray
appeared, the earl instantly suspected his errand. &quot;You have not
dined,&quot; said he, without suffering him to open his commission: &quot;it is
ill talking between a full man and a fasting.&quot; While Gray was at meat,
the unfortunate prisoner was, by Douglas's command, led forth to the
court-yard and beheaded. When the repast was finished, the king's
letter was presented and opened. &quot;Sir Patrick,&quot; says Douglas, leading
Gray to the court, &quot;right glad had I been to honour the king's
messenger; but you have come too late. Yonder lies your sister's son,
without the head: you are welcome to his dead body.&quot; Gray, having
mounted his horse, turned to the earl, and expressed his wrath in a
deadly oath, that he would requite the injury with Douglas's heart's
blood.&mdash;&quot;To horse!&quot; cried the haughty baron, and the messenger of
his prince was pursued till within a few miles of Edinburgh. Gray,
however, had an opportunity of keeping his vow; for, being upon guard
in the king's anti-chamber at Stirling, when James, incensed at the
insolence of the earl, struck him with his dagger, Sir Patrick rushed
in, and dispatched him with a pole-axe. The castle of Thrieve was the
last of the fortresses which held out for the house of Douglas, after

<a name="THE_LADS_OF_WAMPHRAY"></a><h2>THE LADS OF WAMPHRAY.</h2>
<br />

<p>The reader will find, prefixed to the foregoing ballad, an account
of the noted feud betwixt the families of Maxwell and Johnstone.
The following song celebrates the skirmish, in 1593, betwixt the
Johnstones and Crichtons, which led to the revival of the ancient
quarrel betwixt Johnstone and Maxwell, and finally to the battle of
Dryffe Sands, in which the latter lost his life. Wamphray is the name
of a parish in Annandale. Lethenhall was the abode of Johnstone of
Wamphray, and continued to be so till of late years. William Johnstone
of Wamphray, called the <i>Galliard</i>, was a noted freebooter.
A place, near the head of Tiviotdale, retains the name of the
<i>Galliard's Faulds</i>, (folds) being a valley where he used
to secrete and divide his spoil, with his Liddesdale and Eskdale
associates. His <i>nom de guerre</i> seems to have been derived
from the dance called <i>The Galliard</i>. The word is still used in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page274" id="page274">[274]</a></span>
Scotland, to express an active, gay, dissipated character.<a name="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> Willie
of the Kirkhill, nephew to the Galliard, and his avenger, was also a
noted border robber. Previous to the battle of Dryffe Sands, so
often mentioned, tradition reports, that Maxwell had offered a
ten-pound-land to any of his party, who should bring him the head or
hand of the laird of Johnstone. This being reported to his antagonist,
he answered, he had not a ten-pound-land to offer, but would give a
five-merk-land to the man who should that day cut off the head or hand
of Lord Maxwell. Willie of the Kirkhill, mounted upon a young gray
horse, rushed upon the enemy, and earned the reward, by striking down
their unfortunate chieftain, and cutting off his right hand.</p>

<p>Leverhay, Stefenbiggin, Girth-head, &amp;c. are all situated in the parish
of Wamphray. The Biddes-burn, where the skirmish took place betwixt
the Johnstones and their pursuers, is a rivulet which takes its course
among the mountains on the confines of Nithesdale and Annandale. The
Wellpath is a pass by which the Johnstones were retreating to their
fastnesses in Annandale. Ricklaw-holm is a place upon the Evan water,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page275" id="page275">[275]</a></span>
which falls into the Annan, below Moffat. Wamphray-gate was in these
days an ale-house. With these local explanations, it is hoped the
following ballad will be easily understood.</p>

<p>From a pedigree in the appeal case of Sir James Johnstone of Westeraw,
claiming the honours and titles of Annandale, it appears that the
Johnstones of Wamphray were descended from James, sixth son of the
sixth baron of Johnstone. The male line became extinct in 1657.</p>

Similar grants of land were made to Finnart and Arran, the two
branches of the house of Hamilton; to the chiefs of the Battisons;
but, above all, to the Earl of Angus who obtained from royal favour a
donation of the Lordship of Douglas, and many other lands, now held
by Lord Douglas, as his representative. There appears, however, to be
some doubt, whether, in this division, the Earl of Angus received more
than his natural right. Our historians, indeed, say, that William I.
Earl of Douglas, had three sons; 1. James, the 2d Earl, who died
in the field of Otterburn; 2. Archibald, the Grim, 3d Earl; and 3.
George, in right of his mother, earl of Angus. Whether, however, this
Archibald was actually the son of William, seems very doubtful; and
Sir David Dalrymple has strenuously maintained the contrary. Now, if
Archibald, the Grim, intruded into the earldom of Douglas, without
being a son of that family, it follows that the house of Angus, being
kept out of their just rights for more than a century, were only
restored to them after the battle of Arkinholme. Perhaps, this may
help to account for the eager interest taken by the earl of Angus
against his kinsman.&mdash;<i>Remarks on History of Scotland</i>,

present in court, when the Earl of Angus was highly praised for
strength and valour. &quot;It may be,&quot; answered Spens, &quot;if all be good that
is upcome;&quot; insinuating, that the courage of the earl might not answer
the promise of his person. Shortly after, Angus, while hawking near
Borthwick, with a single attendant, met Kilspindie. &quot;What reason had
ye,&quot; said the earl, &quot;for making question of my manhood? thou art a
tall fellow, and so am I; and by St. Bride of Douglas, one of us shall
pay for it!&quot;&mdash;&quot;Since it may be no better,&quot; answered Kilspindie, &quot;I
will defend myself against the best earl in Scotland.&quot; With these
words they encountered fiercely, till Angus, with one blow, severed
the thigh of his antagonist, who died upon the spot. The earl then
addressed the attendant of Kilspindie: &quot;Go thy way: tell my gossip,
the king, that here was nothing but fair play. I know my gossip will
be offended; but I will get me into Liddisdale, and remain in my
castle of the Hermitage till his anger be abated.&quot;&mdash;<i>Godscroft</i>,
Vol. II. p. 59. The price of the earl's pardon seems to have been the
exchange mentioned in the text. Bothwell is now the residence of Lord
Douglas. The sword, with which Archibald, <i>Bell-the-Cat</i>, slew
Spens, was, by his descendant, the famous Earl of Morton, presented to
Lord Lindsay of the Byres, when, about to engage in single combat with
Bothwell, at Carberry-hill&mdash;<i>Godscroft</i>, Vol. II. p. 175.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7">[7]</a><div class="note"><p> The particulars of this encounter are interesting. The
Hamiltons were the most numerous party, drawn chiefly from the western
counties. Their leaders met in the palace of Archbishop Beaton, and
resolved to apprehend Angus, who was come to the city to attend the
convention of estates. Gawain Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, a near
relation of Angus, in vain endeavoured to mediate betwixt the
factions. He appealed to Beaton, and invoked his assistance to prevent
bloodshed. &quot;On my conscience,&quot; answered the archbishop, &quot;I cannot
help what is to happen.&quot; As he laid his hand upon his breast, at this
solemn declaration, the hauberk, concealed by his rocket, was heard
to clatter: &quot;Ah! my lord!&quot; retorted Douglas, &quot;your conscience sounds
hollow.&quot; He then expostulated with the secular leaders, and
Sir Patrick Hamilton, brother to Arran, was convinced by his
remonstrances; but Sir James, the natural son of the earl, upbraided
his uncle with reluctance to fight. &quot;False bastard!&quot; answered Sir
Patrick, &quot;I will fight to day where thou darest not be seen.&quot; With
these words they rushed tumultuously towards the high-street, where
Angus, with the prior of Coldinghame, and the redoubted Wedderburn,
waited their assault, at the head of 400 spearmen, the flower of the
east marches, who, having broke down the gate of the Netherbow, had
arrived just in time to the earl's assistance. The advantage of the
ground, and the disorder of the Hamiltons, soon gave the day to Angus.
Sir Patrick Hamilton, and the master of Montgomery, were slain. Arran,
and Sir James Hamilton, escaped with difficulty; and with no less
difficulty was the military prelate of Glasgow rescued from the
ferocious borderers, by the generous interposition of Gawain Douglas.
The skirmish was long remembered in Edinburgh, by the name of

to him, resolved to throw himself on his clemency. As James returned
from hunting in the park at Stirling, he saw a person at a distance,
and, turning to his nobles, exclaimed, &quot;Yonder is my <i>Graysteil</i>,
Archibald of Kilspindie!&quot; As he approached, Douglas threw himself
on his knees, and implored permission to lead an obscure life in his
native land. But the name of Douglas was an amulet, which steeled
the king's heart against the influence of compassion and juvenile
recollection. He passed the suppliant without an answer, and rode
briskly up the steep hill, towards the castle. Kilspindie, though
loaded with a hauberk under his cloaths, kept pace with the horse, in
vain endeavouring to catch a glance from the implacable monarch. He
sat down at the gate, weary and exhausted, and asked for a draught
of water. Even this was refused by the royal attendants. The king
afterwards blamed their discourtesy; but Kilspindie was obliged to
return to France, where he died of a broken heart; the same disease
which afterwards brought to the grave his unrelenting sovereign.
Even the stern Henry VIII. blamed his nephew's conduct, quoting the
generous saying &quot;A king's face should give grace.&quot;&mdash;<i>Godscroft</i>,

extracted from a journal of principal events, in the years 1570, 1571,
1572, and part of 1573, kept by Richard Bannatyne, amanuensis to John
Knox. The fourt of September, they of Edinburgh, horsemen and futmen

is owres;' and so a certaine come to everie grit manis ludgene, and
apprehendit the Lordis Mortoun and Glencarne; but Mortounis hous they

being appointed to the regentes hous, desyred him to cum furth, which
he had no will to doe, yet, be perswasione of Garleys and otheris,
with him, tho't it best to come in will, nor to byde the extremitie,

Captane Crawfurde, being in the town, gat sum men out of the castell,
and uther gentlemen being in the town, come as they my't best to the

Cader, wha confessed, that he did it at comande of George Bell, wha
was comandit so to doe be the Lord Huntlie and Claud Hamilton. Some

save him, but it culd not be, the furie was so grit of the presewaris,

curious extracts from <i>Mercurius Politicus</i>, a newspaper,
published during the usurpation.
</p><p>
&quot;<i>Thursday, November 11, 1662</i>.
</p><p>
&quot;Edinburgh.&mdash;The Scotts and moss-troopers have again revived their
old custom, of robbing and murdering the English, whether soldiers or
other, upon all opportunities, within these three weeks. We have had
notice of several robberies and murders, committed by them. Among
the rest, a lieutenant, and one other of Col. Overton's regiment,
returning from England, were robbed not far from Dunbarr. A
lieutenant, lately master of the customs at Kirkcudbright, was killed
about twenty miles from this place; and four foot soldiers of Colonel
Overton's were killed, going to their quarters, by some mossers, who,
after they had given them quarter, tied their hands behind them, and
then threw them down a steep hill, or rock, as it was related by a
Scotchman, who was with them, but escaped.&quot;
</p><p>
<i>Ibidem.&mdash;&quot;October</i> 13, 1663.&mdash;The Parliament, October 21, past
an act, declaring, any person that shall discover any felon, or felons
(commonly called, or known, by the name of moss-troopers), residing
upon the borders of England and Scotland, shall have a reward of ten
pound upon their conviction.&quot;</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33">[33]</a><div class="note"><p> The armorial bearings, adopted by many of the border
tribes, shew how little they were ashamed of their trade of rapine.
Like <i>Falstaff</i>, they were &quot;Gentlemen of the night, minions
of the moon,&quot; under whose countenance they committed their
depredations.&mdash;Hence, the emblematic moons and stars, so frequently
charged in the arms of border families. Their mottoes, also, bear
allusion to their profession.&mdash;&quot;<i>Reparabit cornua Phaebe</i>,&quot; i.e.
&quot;We'll have moon-light again,&quot; is that of the family of Harden. &quot;Ye

<a name="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35">[35]</a><div class="note"><p> The following tradition is also illustrative of Lesley's
account. Veitch of Dawyk, a man of great strength and bravery who
flourished in the 16th century, was upon bad terms with a neighbouring
proprietor, Tweedie of Drummelziar. By some accident, a flock of
Dawyk's sheep had strayed over into Drummelziar's grounds, at the time
when <i>Dickie of the Den</i>, a Liddesdale outlaw, was making his
rounds in Tweeddale. Seeing this flock of sheep; he drove them off
without ceremony. Next morning, Veitch, perceiving his loss, summoned
his servants and retainers, laid a blood-hound upon the traces of the
robber, by whom they were guided for many miles, till, on the banks of
Liddel, he staid upon a very large hay-stack. The pursuers were a good
deal surprised at the obstinate pause of the blood-hound, till Dawyk
pulled down some of the hay, and discovered a large excavation,
containing the robbers and their spoil. He instantly flew upon Dickie,
and was about to poniard him, when the marauder, with the address
noticed by Lesley, protested that he would never have touched a
<i>cloot</i> (hoof) of them, had he not taken them for Drummelziar's
property. This dexterous appeal to Veitch's passions saved the life of
the freebooter.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36">[36]</a><div class="note"><p> This practice of the marchmen was observed and
reprobated by Patten. &quot;Anoother maner have they (<i>the English
borderers</i>) amoong them, of wearyng handkerchers roll'd about their
armes, and letters brouder'd (<i>embroidered</i>) upon their cappes:
they said themselves, the use thearof was that ech of them might knowe
his fellowe, and thearbye the sooner assemble, or in nede to ayd one
another, and such lyke respectes; howbeit, thear wear of the army
amoong us (sum suspicious men perchaunce), that thought thei used them
for collusion, and rather bycaus thei might be knowen to the enemie,
as the enemies are knowen to them (for thei have their markes too),
and so in conflict either ech to spare oother, or gently eche to take
oother. Indede men have been mooved the rather to thinke so, bycaus
sum of their crosses (<i>the English red cross</i>) were so narrowe,
and so singly set on, that a puff of wynde might blowed them from
their breastes, and that thei wear found right often talking with the
Skottish prikkers within less than their gad's (<i>spears</i>) length
asunder; and when thei perceived thei had been espied, thei have
begun one to run at anoother, but so apparently perlassent (<i>in
parley</i>), as the lookers on resembled their chasyng lyke the
running at base in an uplondish toun, whear the match is made for
a quart of good ale, or like the play in Robin Cookes scole (<i>a
fencing school</i>), whear, bycaus the punies may lerne, thei strike
fewe strokes but by assent and appointment. I hard sum men say, it
did mooch augment their suspicion that wey, bycaus at the battail they
sawe these prikkers so badly demean them, more intending the taking of
prisoners, than the surety of victorye; for while oother men fought,
thei fell to their prey; that as thear wear but fewe of them but
brought home his prisoner, so wear thear many that had six or
seven.&quot;&mdash;<i>Patten's Account of Somerset's Expedition, apud Dalyell's
Fragments</i>, p. 76.

It is singular that, about this very period, the same circumstances
are severely animadverted upon by the strenuous Scottishman, who wrote
the <i>Complaynt of Scotland</i>, as well as by the English author
above quoted. &quot;There is nothing that is occasione of your adhering

attendance upon rentals, and reserved only some few manses for their
own sustenance, which were laboured by their tenants, besides their
service. They paid an entry, a herauld, and a small rental-duty; for
there were no rents raised here that were considerable, till King

<a name="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51">[51]</a><div class="note"><p> One of the most noted apparitions is supposed to haunt
Spedlin's castle, near Lochmaben, the ancient baronial residence
of the Jardines of Applegirth. It is said, that, in exercise of his
territorial jurisdiction, one of the ancient lairds had imprisoned,
in the <i>Massy More</i>, or dungeon of the castle, a person named
Porteous. Being called suddenly to Edinburgh, the laird discovered, as
he entered the West Port, that he had brought along with him the
key of the dungeon. Struck with the utmost horror, he sent back his
servant to relieve the prisoner; but it was too late. The wretched
being was found lying upon the steps descending from the door of the
vault, starved to death. In the agonies of hunger, he had gnawed the
flesh from one of his arms. That his spectre should haunt the castle
was a natural consequence of such a tragedy. Indeed, its visits became
so frequent, that a clergyman of eminence was employed to exorcise it.
After a contest of twenty-four hours, the man of art prevailed so far
as to confine the goblin to the <i>Massy More</i> of the castle, where
its shrieks and cries are still heard. A part, at least, of the spell,
depends upon the preservation of the ancient black-lettered bible,
employed by the exorcist. It was some years ago thought necessary
to have this bible re-bound; but, as soon as it was removed from the
castle, the spectre commenced his nocturnal orgies, with ten-fold
noise; and it is verily believed that he would have burst from his
confinement, had not the sacred volume been speedily replaced.
</p><p>
A Mass John Scott, minister of Peebles, is reported to have been the
last renowned exorciser, and to have lost his life in a contest with
an obstinate spirit. This was owing to the conceited rashness of a
young clergyman, who commenced the ceremony of laying the ghost before
the arrival of Mass John. It is the nature, it seems, of spirits
disembodied, as well as embodied, to increase in strength and
presumption, in proportion to the advantages which they may gain over
the opponent. The young clergyman losing courage, the horrors of the
scene were increased to such a degree, that, as Mass John approached
the house in which it passed, he beheld the slates and tiles flying
from the roof, as if dispersed by a whirlwind. At his entry, he
perceived all the wax-tapers (the most essential instruments of
conjuration) extinguished, except one, which already burned blue in
the socket. The arrival of the experienced sage changed the scene: he
brought the spirit to reason; but, unfortunately, while addressing a
word of advice or censure to his rash brother, he permitted the
ghost to obtain the <i>last word</i>; a circumstance which, in all
colloquies of this nature, is strictly to be guarded against. This
fatal oversight occasioned his falling into a lingering disorder, of
which he never recovered.

<i>L'Allegro</i>.
</p><p>
When the menials in a Scottish family protracted their vigils around
the kitchen fire, Brownie, weary of being excluded from the midnight
hearth, sometimes appeared at the door, seemed to watch their
departure, and thus admonished them&mdash;&quot;Gang a' to your beds, sirs, and
dinna put out the wee <i>grieshoch</i> (embers).&quot;</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54">[54]</a><div class="note"><p> It is told of a Brownie, who haunted a border family,
now extinct, that the lady having fallen unexpectedly in labour,
and the servant, who was ordered to ride to Jedburgh for the <i>sage
femme</i>, shewing no great alertness in setting out, the familiar
spirit slipt on the great-coat of the lingering domestic, rode to the
town on the laird's best horse, and returned with the mid-wife <i>en
croupe</i>. Daring the short space of his absence, the Tweed, which
they must necessarily ford, rose to a dangerous height. Brownie, who
transported his charge with all the rapidity of the ghostly lover of
<i>Lenor&eacute;</i>, was not to be stopped by this obstacle. He plunged
in with the terrified old lady, and landed her in safety where her
services were wanted. Having put the horse into the stable (where it
was afterwards found in a woeful plight), he proceeded to the room of
the servant, whose duty he had discharged; and, finding him just
in the act of drawing on his boots, he administered to him a most
merciless drubbing with his own horse-whip. Such an important service
excited the gratitude of the laird; who, understanding that Brownie
had been heard to express a wish to have a green coat, ordered a
vestment of that colour to be made, and left in his haunts. Brownie
took away the green coat, but never was seen more. We may suppose,
that, tired of his domestic drudgery, he went in his new livery to
join the fairies.&mdash;<i>See Appendix</i>, No. VI.
</p><p>
The last Brownie, known in Ettrick forest, resided in Bodsbeck, a wild
and solitary spot, where he exercised his functions undisturbed, till
the scrupulous devotion of an old lady induced her to <i>hire him
away</i>, as it was termed, by placing in his haunt a porringer of
milk and a piece of money. After receiving this hint to depart, he was
heard the whole night to howl and cry, &quot;Farewell to bonny Bodsbeck!&quot;
which he was compelled to abandon for ever.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55">[55]</a><div class="note"><p> One of his pranks is thus narrated: Two men, in a very
dark night, approaching the banks of the Ettrick, heard a doleful
voice from its waves repeatedly exclaim&mdash;&quot;Lost! lost!&quot;&mdash;They followed
the sound, which seemed to be the voice of a drowning person, and, to
their infinite astonishment, they found that it ascended the river.
Still they continued, during a long and tempestuous night, to follow
the cry of the malicious sprite; and arriving, before morning's dawn,
at the very sources of the river, the voice was now heard descending
the opposite side of the mountain in which they arise. The fatigued
and deluded travellers now relinquished the pursuit; and had no sooner
done so, than they heard Shellycoat applauding, in loud bursts of
laughter, his successful roguery. The spirit was supposed particularly
to haunt the old house of Gorrinberry, situated on the river
Hermitage, in Liddesdale.</p></div>

spirits. When the lady of the family has a child, the queen of the
silent people is delivered in the same moment. They endeavour to give

<a name="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59">[59]</a><div class="note"><p> We may form some idea of the stile of life maintained
by the border warriors, from the anecdotes, handed down by tradition,
concerning Walter Scott of Harden, who flourished towards the
middle of the sixteenth century. This ancient laird was a renowned
freebooter, and used to ride with a numerous band of followers. The
spoil, which they carried off from England, or from their neighbours,
was concealed in a deep and impervious glen, on the brink of which the
old tower of Harden was situated. From thence the cattle were brought
out, one by one, as they were wanted, to supply the rude and plentiful
table of the laird. When the last bullock was killed and devoured, it
was the lady's custom to place on the table a dish, which, on being
uncovered, was found to contain a pair of clean spurs; a hint to the
riders, that they must shift for their next meal. Upon one occasion,
when the village herd was driving out the cattle to pasture, the
old laird heard him call loudly <i>to drive out Harden's cow</i>.
&quot;<i>Harden's cow!</i>&quot; echoed the affronted chief&mdash;&quot;Is it come to that
pass? by my faith they shall sune say Harden's <i>kye</i> (cows).&quot;
Accordingly, he sounded his bugle, mounted his horse, set out with
his followers, and returned next day with &quot;<i>a bow of kye, and a
bussen'd</i> (brindled) <i>bull</i>.&quot; On his return with this gallant
prey, he passed a very large hay-stack. It occurred to the provident
laird, that this would be extremely convenient to fodder his new stock
of cattle; but as no means of transporting it occurred, he was fain
to take leave of it with this apostrophe, now proverbial: &quot;By my soul,
had ye but four feet, ye should not stand lang there.&quot; In short, as
Froissard says of a similar class of feudal robbers, nothing came
amiss to them, that was not <i>too heavy, or too hot</i>. The same
mode of house-keeping characterized most border families on both
sides. An MS. quoted in <i>History of Cumberland</i>, p. 466,
concerning the Graemes of Netherby, and others of that clan, runs
thus: &quot;They were all stark moss-troopers and arrant thieves: both to
England and Scotland outlawed: yet sometimes connived at, because they
gave intelligence forth of Scotland, and would raise 400 horse at any
time, upon a raid of the English into Scotland.&quot; A saying is recorded
of a mother to her son (which is now become proverbial), &quot;<i>Ride
Rouly</i> (Rowland), <i>hough's i' the pot</i>;&quot; that is, the last
piece of beef was in the pot, and therefore it was high time for him
to go and fetch more. To such men might with justice be applied the
poet's description of the Cretan warrior; translated by my friend, Dr.
Leyden.

Ker's clan and followers. Two dependants of the deceased, called Tait,
were deputed by Andrew Ker of Cessford to revenge his father's
murder. They travelled through England in various disguises till they
discovered the place of Starhead's retreat, murdered him in his bed,
and brought his head in triumph to Edinburgh, where Ker caused it to
be exposed at the cross. The bastard Heron would have shared the same

inaccurate. Buccleuch was indeed delivered into England, but this was
done in consequence of the judgment of commissioners of both nations,
who met at Berwick this same year. And his delivery took place, less
on account of the raid of Carlisle, than of a second exploit of the
same nature, to be noticed hereafter.</p></div>

<a name="Footnote_160_160"></a><a href="#FNanchor_160_160">[160]</a><div class="note"><p> Such traits of generosity illuminate the dark period of
which we treat. Carey's conduct, on this occasion, almost atones
for the cold and unfeeling policy with which he watched the closing
moments of his benefactress, Elizabeth, impatient till remorse and
sorrow should extort her last sigh, that he might lay the foundation
of his future favour with her successor, by carrying him the
first tidings of her death.&mdash;<i>Carey's Memoirs</i>, p. 172. <i>et
sequen</i>. It would appear that Sir Robert Ker was soon afterwards
committed to the custody of the archbishop of York; for there is
extant a letter from that prelate to the lord-treasurer, desiring
instructions about the mode of keeping this noble hostage. &quot;I
understand,&quot; saith he, &quot;that the gentleman is wise and valiant, but
somewhat haughty here, and resolute. I would pray your lordship, that
I may have directions whether he may not go with his keeper in my
company, to sermons; and whether he may not sometimes dine with
the council, as the last hostages did; and, thirdly, whether he may
sometimes be brought to sitting to the common-hall, where he may see
how careful her majesty is that the poorest subject in her kingdom may
have their right, and that her people seek remedy by law, and not
by avenging themselves. Perhaps it may do him good as long as he
liveth.&quot;&mdash;<i>Strype's Annals, ad annum, 1597</i>. It would appear,
from this letter, that the treatment of the hostages was liberal;
though one can hardly suppress a smile at the zeal of the good bishop
for the conversion of the Scottish chieftain to a more christian mode
of thinking than was common among the borderers of that day. The date
is February 25. 1597, which is somewhat difficult to reconcile with
those given by the Scottish historians&mdash;Another letter follows,
stating, that Sir Robert, having been used to open air, prayed for
more liberty for his health's sake, &quot;offering his word, which it
is said he doth chiefly regard, that he would be true
prisoner.&quot;&mdash;<i>Strype, Ibid.</i></p></div>

Poetry</i> has noticed the perfidy of this clan in another instance;
the delivery of the banished Earl of Northumberland into the hands of
the Scottish regent, by Hector of Harelaw, an Armstrong, with whom he
had taken refuge.&mdash;<i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>, Vol. I. p. 283.
This Hector of Harelaw seems to have been an Englishman, or under
English assurance; for he is one of those, against whom bills were
exhibited, by the Scottish commissioners, to the lord-bishop of
Carlisle.&mdash;<i>Introduction to the History of Westmoreland and
Cumberland</i>, p. 81. In the list of borderers, 1597, Hector of
Harelaw, with the Griefs and Cuts of Harelaw, also figures as an
inhabitant of the Debateable Land. It would appear, from a spirited
invective in the Maitland MSS. against the regent, and those who
delivered up the unfortunate earl to Elizabeth, that Hector had been
guilty of this treachery, to redeem the pledge which had been exacted
from him for his peaceable demeanour. The poet says, that the perfidy
of Morton and Lochlevin was worse than even that of&mdash;

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
